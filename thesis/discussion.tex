\todo[inline]{Phrasing here is still similar to phrasing in general intro}

Human brain mapping studies have traditionally averaged \ac{fmri} data across
participants.
%
However, data need to be assessed on the level of individual persons in order to
advance the field towards a clinical application.
% functional localizer
A promising tool to perform this advancement are/is functional localizers
[because localizers aim to characterize the location size, and shape of
functional areas on the level of individual subject].
% contra localizers
However, traditional localizer paradigms employ selectively sampled, tightly
controlled stimuli, rely heavily on a participant's compliance, and can usually
map just one domain of brain functions
% naturalistic stimuli could replace
Localizer paradigms based on naturalistic stimuli could provide higher
ecological as well as external validity, higher data quality due to increased
compliance, and potentially map a variety of brain functions [ranging from
low-level perception (e.g., luminance) to high-level cognition (e.g., social
cognition)] simultaneously.
% visually impaired
Lastly, an exclusively auditory stimulus like an audiobook or audio drama would
also be appropriate for visually impaired persons[, e.g., suffering from
nystagmus or lack of eyesight].
% PPA as proof of concept
This thesis focused on the \ac{ppa}, a classic higher-visual area,
\citep{epstein1998ppa}, in order to explore whether a movie and the movie's
audio-description could, in principle, substitute a traditional localizer
paradigm.


\paragraph{One-sentences-summaries of work packages}

\todo[inline]{maybe, very short summary of parts here}

%
First, we extended the studyforrest dataset (study 1).
%
Second and similarly to traditional localizer paradigms, we modeled hemodynamic
activity based on annotated stimulus features embedded in the movie ``Forrest
Gump'' and its audio-description, and created \ac{glm} $t$-contrasts in order to
localize the \ac{ppa} (study 2).
%
Third, we estimated results of the localizer by projecting data through a
\ac{cfs} (study 3).


\paragraph{Open science}

% intro
The overarching, self-imposed goal of this dissertation was to perform all
studies under the principles of open, shared, and transparent science.
% mention Datalad
Created data, code, analysis step, and results are published as
version-controlled DataLad
\citep[\href{www.datalad.org}{datalad.org};][]{halchenko2021datalad} dataset in
order to meet the requirements of a reproducible research project.
% datalad rerun
Independent researchers can rerun all performed analyses in order to validate
current results and use written code in order to replicate current findings
in prospective studies.



\section{Recapitulation of work packages}

\todo[inline]{maybe, give an overview of how the remaining part of the thesis is
structured: study as such, study in light of open science, general assessment
of open science, conclusion on naturalistic stimuli as localizer, conclusion on
naturalistic stimuli in general}


\subsection{Speech anno}


\subsubsection{Goal of speech anno}

% what we did in 1 sentence
In study 1 \citep{haeusler2021speechanno}, we created and validated an
annotation of speech occurring in the movie and its audio-description pursuing
two goals.
% aim #1: groundwork for PPA study
The first aim was to build the groundwork that enabled us to conduct study 2.
% aim #2: extend studyforrest
The second aim was to create an exhaustive annotation of speech that
substantially exceeds the groundwork necessary to conduct study 2 in order to
extend the studyforrest dataset as a public resource for independent research.


\subsubsection{Discussion of speech anno}

% validation analysis
We validated the annotation's quality in study 1 and performed a canonical
\ac{glm} analysis by contrasting regressors correlating with speech-related
events to a regressor correlating with events without speech.
% results
As hypothesized, results revealed statistically significant increased
hemodynamic activity in a bilateral cortical network known to be involved in the
perception of speech \citep[e.g.,][]{friederici2011brain, wilson2008beyond}.
% conclusion
These results encouraged us to a) use the annotation as the groundwork for study
2, b) publish the annotation as an extension of the studyforrest project.


\subsubsection{Open science in context of speech anno}

\todo[inline]{how "personal" am I supposed to get?}

% additional effort 1
Pursuing the goal of creating a publication-worthy dataset led to additional
work that would not have been necessary to create the groundwork to perform
study 2.
% additional effort 2
The published annotation's content goes far beyond what was necessary to build
the \ac{glm} in study 2 in a standardized format:
%
the annotation provides information about, e.g., time-stamps of phonemes, words
and sentences of all speakers, a grammatical tagging, and an annotation of
syntactic dependencies and semantics.
%
Great care was taken during the creation and iterative correction of additional
information in order to provide accurate information to the scientific
community.
%
However, it became apparent that there is not such thing as a ``perfect''
annotation:
%
an annotation of speech will always contain ambiguities and noise.
%
Additionally, further processing steps needed to be balanced between just
providing the mere minimum and providing a sound groundwork for potential
use-cases that also needed to be anticipated.
%
Every further processing step might be based on decisions that might not be
align potential uses cases.
%
Therefore, there is a trade-off between doing the mere minimum and putting time
and effort in creating additional information that might not be fruitful.
%
For example, an annotation of semantics might be based on a current state-of-the
art language model that might be superseded by future language models.


\subsubsection{Conclusion on speech anno}
%
Therefore, the publicly available annotation does not just include the
annotation as such but also provides raw data and documented code that led to
the annotation.
%
Consequently, the outcome of study 1 widens the ``annotation bottleneck''
\citep{aliko2020naturalistic} and potentially lays the foundation for
independent research projects.
%
Nevertheless, it provides extensive information about the time course of
stimulus features, and therefore a headstart to independent researchers that
wish to ``model hemodynamic brain responses that correlate with a variety of
aspects of spoken language ranging from a speaker's identity, to phonetics,
grammar, syntax, and semantics'' \citep{haeusler2021speechanno} under more
real-life like conditions.
%
A third-party annotation of speech, as is, will never be ``finished'', and match
all use cases but needs adjusted for study-specific needs and updated, e.g., in
case more advanced language models emerge.


\subsection{PPA paper}

\subsubsection{Recapitulation}

\paragraph{Goal of PPA paper}
% study in one sentence
The goal of study 2 investigate whether an audio-visual and an exclusively
auditory naturalistic stimulus could be used in order to localize the \ac{ppa}
as it was previously identified in the same set of participants by a traditional
block-design functional localizer that employed static pictures
\citep{sengupta2016extension}.


\paragraph{Method, Results \& Discussion of PPA paper}
% AV operationalization
For the model-based mass-univariate statistical (i.e. \ac{glm}) analysis of the
movie's data, we operationalized the perception of visual spatial information
based on an annotation of movie cuts and depicted locations
\citep{haeusler2016cutanno}.
% AD operationalization
For the \ac{glm} analysis of the audio-description's data, we extended the
annotation of speech \citep{haeusler2021speechanno} by further annotating nouns
that the narrator uses to describe the movie's absent visual content.

% group results: AV \& AD
On a group-average level, findings demonstrate that increased activation in the
\ac{ppa} generalizes to the perception of spatial information embedded in the
audio-visual movie and its audio-description.
% individual AD
``On an individual level, we find significant bilateral activity correlating
with semantic spatial information occurring in the audio-description in the
anterior \ac{ppa} of nine individuals and unilateral activity in one
individual'' \citep{haeusler2022processing}.

% conclusion 1
Results add evidence \citep[cf.][]{bartels2004mapping} that a functionally
defined region, such as the \ac{ppa}, can be localized using a model-driven
\ac{glm} analysis that is based on a naturalistic stimulus' annotated temporal
structure.
% conclusion 2
Results also suggest that a purely auditory paradigm like an audio-description
could, in principle, substitute a visual localizer as a diagnostic procedure to
assess brain functions in visually impaired individuals
[phrasing pretty similar to \citep{haeusler2022processing}].


\subsubsection{Future studies: PPA}

%
Two aspect revealed by our analyses invite further investigations on the
properties of the \ac{ppa}:
%
a) the responses correlating with an auditory stimulation are spatially
restricted to the anterior \ac{ppa}, and
%
b) higher intersubject variability of responses of the \ac{ppa} to a
naturalistic auditory stimulation compared to the visual stimulation during the
localizer and movie paradigm.


\paragraph{Just anterior PPA during auditory stimultion}

\todo[inline]{check part in the paper again}

% statement
Clusters of significantly increased activation correlation with auditory spatial
information are restricted to the anterior \ac{ppa}.
% question
This raises the question [phrase the question].

% our interpretation
Previous studies in the field of visual perception provide evidence that the PPA
can be divided into functionally subregions that might process different
stimulus features.
%
Hence, we attributed the revealed pattern to different features inherent in the
visual stimuli compared to a purely auditory stimulus [phrasing pretty similar
to \citep{haeusler2022processing}].
%
However, ``due to the nature of the datasets investigated here, such an
attribution can only be preliminary, because the auditory stimulation dataset
also differs in key acquisition properties (field-strength, resolution) from the
comparison datasets, representing a confound of undetermined impact''
\citep{haeusler2022processing}.

% conclusion
Future studies employing controlled stimuli could investigate if our results are
replicable when comparing results from a visual paradigm to a auditory paradigm.



\paragraph{Interindividual variability in response to auditory stimulation}

% statement
On an individual-level, we observe variability of responses across study
participants during the naturalistic auditory stimulation compared to the
stimulation during the localizer paradigm:
%
``We find significant bilateral activity correlating with semantic spatial
information occurring in the audio-description in the anterior \ac{ppa} of nine
individuals and unilateral activity in one individual''.

% not necessarily noise
The divergent pattern from the group mean in four of fourteen individuals should
not necessarily attributed to measurement error/artefacts or ``random noise''
but could also be attributed to individual differences in responses to the task
free, auditory paradigm.

% Kanai
``These differences [in the structure of grey matter and white matter tracts]
are typically viewed as measurement errors or as uninteresting peculiarities of
individuals, and are therefore discarded.

%
However, if they are highly consistent across different tests, then they are
characteristics of the individuals and may ultimately reflect differences in
their brain function'' \citep{kanai2011structural}.



\paragraph{Possible factors (to explored)}

%
While ``the movie stimulus shares the stimulation in the visual domain with
classical localizer stimuli, while featuring real-life-like visual complexity
and naturalistic auditory stimulation, the audio-description maintains the
naturalistic nature of the movie stimulus, but limited to the auditory domain''
\citep{haeusler2022processing}.

%
Future studies could assess the stability / reliability activity patterns of
single individuals in response to a paradigm using controlled auditory
stimulation and task-free, auditory stimulation.
%
Hence, increased variability could be attributed to
%
a) auditory spatial information,
%
b) naturalistic paradigm
%
c) interaction between auditory spatial information and naturalistic paradigm.


\paragraph{Situational factors}

The influence of
%
a) experimental design (incidentally presented information, task-free
(participants naive to the process being investigated; kind of a classic ``test
effect''),
%
b) stimulus type (not carefully chosen, prototypical stimuli, "more random
sampling"),
%
c) our adventurous modeling approach [?],
%
d) laboratory environment,
%
e) [transient] state of the subject (alertness, fatigue, leading to differential
engagement).



\paragraph{Cognitive factors}
%
``such as other differences in cognitive style or executive functioning
ability'' \citep{vanhorn2008individual}:
%
Individually different ``susceptibility / predisposition [?] to attend, select,
recognize, process, encode'' incidentally occurring auditory spatial information
embedded in the audio-description specifically.

%
Differences in cognitive tendencies or cognitive capacities


\paragraph{Other factors}

``physiological factors (such as differences in white matter connectivity,
resting state metabolism, or recent caffeine consumption), personality factors, or genetic differences'' \citep{vanhorn2008individual}.


\paragraph{Brain \& behavior: intro to "fingerprints"}

\todo[inline]{following is pretty speculative 'cause relability of differences
is premise}

%
``Topological variations are not likely to be entirely random noise but present
useful phenotypes or biomarkers'' \citep{vanhorn2008individual}.
%
``Topological outliers can also be considered to be interesting cases of
inter-individual variability to understand brain-phenotype relationships ''
\citep{eickhoff2018imaging}.
%
``Individual differences and topology (i.e. location, size, shape of functional
areas) and the activity within functional areas should facilitate the dissection
of how each property is related to behavior [e.g. cognitive traits]''
\citep{glasser2016multi}.

% Zhen
``Interindividual variability of functional regions in both functional and
spatial features is a rich and important source of information, should reflect
brain function to some extent, and could be used to reveal the neural basis of
human cognition and behavior'' \citep{zhen2015quantifying}.



\paragraph{Brain \& behavior: example studies}

%
For example, \citet{kong2019spatial} suggested ``that individual-specific network
topography (i.e., location and spatial arrangement) [based on resting-state
functional connectivity measures] might serve as a fingerprint of human
behavior that can predict behavioral phenotypes across cognition, personality,
and emotion [with modest accuary, comparable to previous reports predicting
phenotypes based on connectivity strength]'' \citep{kong2019spatial}.

%
\citet{bijsterbosch2018relationship} found ``[that the shape and exact location
of brain regions interact strongly with the modeling of brain connectivity, and
that the spatial arrangement of functional regions is strongly predictive of
non-imaging measures of behavior and lifestyle''.
%
\citet{bijsterbosch2018relationship} ``found that individual differences in/of
the size, shape and exact position of the brain regions (as identified by
resting-state functional connectivity measures) was strongly related to
individual differences in/of behavioral tests and questionnaires of healthy
individuals [behavioural factors including intelligence, life satisfaction, drug
use and aggression problems]'' \citep{bijsterbosch2018relationship}.

\citep{bijsterbosch2018relationship}'s ``results indicate that spatial variation
in the topography of functional regions across individuals is strongly
associated with behaviour.
%
The fact that these variations in spatial topographical features capture a more
direct and unique representation of subject variability than temporal
correlations between regions defined by group parcellation approaches
(coupling), was unexpected.
%
Hence, the cross-subject information represented in commonly adopted
'connectivity fingerprints' could largely reflect spatial variability in the
location of functional regions across individuals, rather than variability in
coupling strength (at least for methods that directly map group-level
parcellations onto individual data)'' \citep{bijsterbosch2018relationship}.

%
``It is possible that the degree to which spatial information may influence FC
estimates varies considerably across studies, depending on the spatial alignment
algorithm that was used, and the amount of subject spatial variability this has
removed.
%
It is encouraging that significant efforts have recently gone into the methods
for more accurately estimating the spatial location of functional parcels in
individual subjects in recent years [Chong et al., 2017; Glasser et al., 2016;
Gordon et al., 2016; Hacker et al., 2013; Harrison et al., 2015; Varoquaux et
al., 2011; Wang et al., 2015], and into advanced hyperalignment approaches [Chen
et al., 2015; Guntupalli et al., 2016; Guntupalli and Haxby, 2017]''
\citep{bijsterbosch2018relationship}.


\subsubsection{Conclusion on future PPA studies}

% intro
``Future studies are needed to elaborate the interindividual variability of the
SSRs and to utilize the variability in understanding the neural mechanisms of
specific behavioral or cognitive processes (e.g., scene perception)''
\citep{zhen2017quantifying}.

% some examples what could/should be done
Hence, future studies:
%
a) dedicated experiment (with / without any task)
%
b) naturalistic stimulation (with task to attend to spatial information).
%
c) include behavioral measures and control how well sound was perceived, measure
alertness levels, eye-movements, self-reports of what ever [because cognitive
factors might correlated with further encoding into and retrieval from memory]
%
measure alertness, memory, utilization of spatial information for (subsequent
visual) place recognition, spatial orientation, way finding, navigation;
%
processing oral way description and using it for planing,
remembering, executing navigation.


\subsubsection{Future studies: other scene-selective areas}

\todo[inline]{cf. reviewer response of PPA study}

We focused on the \ac{ppa} as a proof-of-concept [we have the masks from
Sengupta]..
%
We (and Sengupta) chose the PPA among three possible candidates (cf. answer to
point 2) because it was the first area to be discovered as a visual
``scene-selective'' region, is the most reliably activated region across studies
that investigate visual scene perception.

%#12 RSC + LOC
``Apart from the PPA, results show significantly increased activity in the
ventral precuneus and posterior cingulate region (referred to as ``retrosplenial
complex'', RSC) of the medial parietal cortex, and in the superior lateral
occipital cortex (referred to as ``occipital place area'', OPA) for both
naturalistic stimuli.
% RSC intro
Like the PPA, the RSC and OPA have repeatedly shown increased hemodynamic
activity in studies investigating visual spatial perception and navigation
\citep{chrastil2018heterogeneity, bettencourt2013role, dilks2013occipital,
epstein2019scene}.

% inference
Thus, our model-driven approach to operationalize spatial perception based on
stimulus annotations reveals increased hemodynamic responses in a network that
is implicated in visual spatial perception and cognition.
% medial parietal cortex: anterior-posterior gradient
Similarly to the parahippocampal cortex \citep{aminoff2013role}, the medial
parietal cortex exhibits a posterior-anterior gradient from being more involved
in perceptual processes to being more involved in memory related processes
\citep{chrastil2018heterogeneity, hassabis2009construction, silson2019posterior,
steel2021network}.

% future studies
Future, complementary studies using specifically designed paradigms could
investigate where in the posterior-anterior axis of the parahippocampal and
medial parietal cortex auditory semantic information is correlated with
increased hemodynamic activity:
% we hypothesize
we hypothesize that the auditory perception of spatial information (compared to
non-spatial information) is correlating with clusters in the middle of possibly
overlapping clusters correlating with visual perception (peak activity more
posterior) and scene construction from memory (peak activity more anterior)''
\citep{haeusler2022processing}.

\subsubsection{Future studies: other functional areas (studyforrest dataset)}

\todo[inline]{cf. discussion of SRM part}

\todo[inline]{check \citep{sengupta2016extension}}

%
However, the localizer performed by \citep{sengupta2016extension} contrasts
that aimed at localizing FFA, OPA, etc.
%
Other mask of functional areas in studyforrest dataset (e.g. for master or
bachelor thesis, or as part of a PhD project).
%
``Future studies that aim to use a movie to localize visual areas in individual
participants should extensively annotate the content of frames (e.g., using the
open-source solution ``Pliers''\citep{mcnamara2017developing} for feature
extraction from a visual naturalistic stimulus)''
\citep{haeusler2022processing}.




\subsubsection{Open science in context of PPA paper}

\paragraph{Goal}
% goal PPA study
Under the perspective of an open science project, one goal of study 2 was to use
already existing \ac{fmri} data \citep{hanke2014audiomovie,
hanke2016simultaneous, sengupta2016extension} of the studyforrest project and
results based on data of the studyforrest \citep{sengupta2016extension} project
for a new research question.
%
Further, we used the published annotation created in study 1, and extended it
for our specific needs in study 2 \citep[cf.][]{haeusler2022processing}.
%

\paragraph{Pro's \& Con's in the process of creating PPA paper}

\todo[inline]{cf. general discussion of open science stuff below}
%
headstart, solid base;
%
you need to trust the dataset creators but still test/[re]check the data
according to your needs (and knowledge).

%
Any further processing steps is based on variables/decisions/parameters.
%
Opportunity costs: take (for granted) what is already done or do it yourself?
%
Raw measures vs. preprocessed data vs. results
%
For example, analyzes in \citet{sengupta2016extension} were performed (and
published) in voxel-space (not surface-space).
%
Resulting masks were restricted to one scene-selective area (\ac{ppa}; no
\ac{rsc}, \ac{opa} = transverse occipital sulcus).
%
Should be very hard to exactly copy the procedure applied to \ac{ppa} to
\ac{rsc} and \ac{opa}.


\paragraph{Results}
% general
Our results suggesting that the PPA is fucking awesome have been published in a
peer-reviewed, open-access journal \citep{haeusler2022processing}.
% in the context of open science
Thus, we were able to interpret the data under a new perspective that was not
foreseen during the original generation of the studyforrest project.


\paragraph{Conclusion}

\todo[inline]{Published in peer-reviewed journal; analyzes are shared, open,
reproducible etc.}

%
Consequently, we successfully reused existing data as a foundation for a new
investigation in order to generate novel findings that illustrate the benefits
of publicly and freely available dataset like the studyforrest project.


\subsection{SRM study}

\todo[inline]{following parts are an old draft}


\subsubsection{Transition from study 2 to study 3}
%
Despite exploratory approach in study 2 (a.k.a. shitty modeling of subjectively
assessed events), results suggest:
%
the response to spatial information must be somewhere in within the response
time seires and is detectable.
%
Hence, we might be able to use the response patterns measured during the
presentation of the audio-description in order to generate a \ac{cfs} [needs to
be defined above in overview] in study 3, and align an ``unknown'' test
participant to that \ac{cfs}.

% align left-out subject
Based on our findings in study 2 \citep{haeusler2022processing}, we assumed that
the event structure in both naturalistic stimuli would correlate, among others,
with brain responses that are similar to those correlating with the event
structure in a dedicated functional localizer.

% summary of study 2
Results of study 2 suggest that a naturalistic stimulus might provide an
engaging, task-free paradigm to localize brain functions in individual subjects.



\subsubsection{Goal of SRM study}

% the problem
Considering practical and monetary constraints in a clinical context, a paradigm
lasting 90 to 120 minutes is inappropriate for even an extensive individual
diagnostic procedure.

% goal 1: new procedure
The first goal was to assess a procedure to estimate results of a dedicated
localizer \citep{sengupta2016extension} based on data acquired during
naturalistic stimulation.
%
Following leave-one-subject out cross-validation, we estimated (i.e. predicted)
the results of the visual localizer experiment ($Z$-values of voxels within a
\ac{roi}) of a left-out test participant based on localizer results of a
reference group.

% goal 2: partial alignment
The second goal was to assessed the relationship between length of
naturalistic stimulation used to align the test participant to the fixed
\ac{cfs} and the estimation performance.
%
Lastly, the estimation performance of our new procedure based on \ac{fa} was
compared an estimation performance based on \ac{aa}.


\paragraph{Hypotheses}
%
We hypothesized that increased quantity of data used to calculate the
transformation matrices of the left-out subjects for a \ac{fa} would to increase
prediction performance.
%
Further, we hypothesized that \ac{fa} would eventually perform
``better'' than an estimation based on \ac{aa}.

\section{Open Science: Conclusions across the whole project}


\subsection{Contra}

\paragraph{Not required, not established}
%
Following the guidelines was not mandatory for submitting the thesis but
constituted voluntary, additional careful work.
%
The additional benefits that go along this additional work are not immediately
visible to researchers/authors.
%
Further, the standards to follow are still emerging and [probably] not yet
standardized [?].
%
Guidelines are not [yet] part of a curriculum, neither in a bachelor's/master's
program nor PhD program and therefore self-imposed and learned based on
self-initiative.


\paragraph{Additional workload}
%
Take extra care to make everything really, really good 'cause other people will
rely on your shit.
%
You have to make your data and script extra pretty so other people can benefit
from your work but you do not benefit yourself from doing more than is necessary
for your own project.
%
Thus it is an added ``burden'' during PhD thesis.

%
People who do not give a shit about it and don't do it, do ``worse'' research
but are faster/``better''.


\paragraph{Science is competition; data leeching}
%
Other working groups (more money, brain/people power) can be faster and can use
your data for similar findings (while you are still busy doing work yet others
can benefit from).


\subsection{Trustful data}

\todo[inline]{check the data you created or others will do it; might get
"embarrassing"}

%
Dataset will never be perfect and will contain noise, or even artefacts.
%
Data description need to be as exhaustive as possible.
%
Re-users need to check the data according to their use case!
%
The unknown unknowns of dataset creators?
%
Quality standards vary from field to field and even within subfields of
neuroscience (a.k.a. ``interessiert uns ja nicht'').
%
Everything that is not explicitly stated needs to be assumed to not be
considered.
%
Which is consequently leading to opportunity costs:


\subsection{Opportunity costs}

Wikipedia: ``opportunity cost of a particular activity is the value or benefit
given up by engaging in that activity, relative to engaging in an alternative
activity.
%
More simply, it means if you chose one activity (for example, an investment) you
are giving up the opportunity to do a different option.
%
The optimal activity is the one that, net of its opportunity cost, provides the
greater return compared to any other activities, net of their opportunity
costs''.

%
You save time and money (especially if you do not collect the data yourself) but
you have to trust that the data are ``good'' and start at some point to reach
goals that you would not accomplished if you would have done all from scratch
(i.e. preprocessing).
%
On the one hand, not spending time on collecting data is speeding up the process
of getting to analyze the data, and go beyond what would have been possible if
you would have collected the data yourself.
%
On the other hand, there is an hard to judge ``correct'' balance between
trusting the work of others that collected the raw data, and checking the data
and familiarize yourself with the data.
%
Researchers need to handle that two-sided sword and balance trusting the
creators of the dataset and checking/validating everything themselves.

%
This essentially boils down to researchers that want to publish data to highly
take care that the dataset gets really, really good, and test and validate the
data substantially and rigorously.
%
Contingencies need to be taken care of and use-cases considered/anticipated that
go beyond the originally anticipated use-cases (``a.k.a. interessiert uns ja
nicht'').

%
The same applies not just for the collection of raw data but also any
preprocessing steps, (that might lead to different results based on parameters,
operation system, software version etc.) or any kind of results.
%
Standardizing the analyses pipelines helps.
%
Nevertheless, there is no "one size fits all" uses-cases.
%
Hence, being able to re-run analyses with custom parameters for specific
use-cases helps
%
In summary, it is mandatory to create awareness, and teach established and
emerging standards to students.

Over the last decade, there has been a growing awareness that results of
scientific publications are not reproducible or general scientific findings are
not replicable letting some authors speak of a ``reproducibility crisis'' or

\section{Conclusion: Naturalistic stimuli as functional localizer}

Summary of PPA paper:
%#13 natural stimulation
``In summary, natural stimuli like movies \citep{eickhoff2020towards,
hasson2008neurocinematics, sonkusare2019naturalistic} or narratives
\citep{hamilton2018revolution, honey2012not, lerner2011topographic,
silbert2014coupled, wilson2008beyond} can be used as a continuous, complex,
immersive, task-free paradigm that more closely resembles our natural dynamic
environment than traditional experimental paradigms.
% method
We took advantage of three fMRI acquisitions and two stimulus annotations that
are part of the open-data resource
\href{http://www.studyforrest.org}{studyforrest.org} to operationalize the
perception of spatial information embedded in an audio-visual movie and an
auditory narrative, and compare current results to a previous report of a
conventional, block-design localizer.
% results
The present study offers evidence that a model-driven GLM analysis based on
annotations can be applied to a naturalistic paradigm to localize concise
functional areas and networks correlating with specific perceptual processes --
an analysis approach that can be facilitated by the neuroscout.org platform
\citep{delavega2021neuroscout}.
% interpretation
More specifically, our results demonstrate that increased activation in the PPA
during the perception of static pictures generalizes to the perception of
spatial information embedded in a movie and an exclusively auditory stimulus.
% interpretation: aPPA vs. pPPA
Our results provide further evidence that the PPA can be divided into functional
subregions that coactivate during the perception of visual scenes.
% interpretation
Finally, the presented evidence on the in-principle suitability of a naturally
engaging, purely auditory paradigm for localizing the PPA may offer a path to
the development of diagnostic procedures more suitable for individuals with
visual impairments or conditions like nystagmus''
\citep{haeusler2022processing}.

\subsubsection{Caveats of naturalistic stimuli}
%
Challenging data data analysis, but create \& share annotation.
%
Hence, data analysis pipelines should be implemented in common and
well-documented packages and code, and custom code shared along the paper.

%
Just an approximation of real life.
%
Setting is still the scanner.
%
Passive watching \& listening.
%
Executive functions?


\subsubsection{Clinical application}

\todo[inline]{most on this topic is in SRM part}

%
``The ability to non-invasively and automatically delineate cortical areas in
living subjects may have clinical implications, for example by providing
neurosurgeons with detailed, individualized maps of the brains on which they
operate'' \citep{glasser2016multi}.

%
A full feature film might substitute traditional localizer paradigms dedicated
localizer by mapping a variety of brain functions beyond category-specific
visual areas.

%
Therefore, a new independent dataset should be collected that employs
naturalistic stimulation.
%
Additional measures of a variety of localizers would enable comparison of
results from analyzing the naturalistic stimuli and results from localizer
contrasts.

%
For example \ac{fmri} could be used as an noninvasive alternative to map
language areas and potentially assess lateralization (or hemispheric asymmetry)
of functional brain topography related to language (sub)functions, in order to
guide pre- and perioperative assessment of neurosurgery, e.g., in case of
epilepsy.

\todo[inline]{language areas are more clinically relevant, but problem in case
of prediction (esp. using ROI): atypical language lateralization \& usually no
lateralization in naturalistic stimuli (but operationalization is different from
localizer paradigms), assumption of (strict) lateralization probably wrong
anyway}

\todo[inline]{Further quotes/templates from papers using \ac{fmri} to localize
language areas are outsourced to separate file}


\section{Conclusion: naturalistic stimuli in general}
%
Naturalistic stimuli are not a panacea but traditional paradigms and
naturalistic paradigms should be used in tandem / reciprocally to generate new
hypotheses and progress our understanding of the brain.


%
In summary, naturalistic stimuli ``impose a meaningful timecourse across
subjects while still allowing for individual variation in brain activity and
behavioral responses, and lend themselves to a broader set of analyses than
either pure rest or pure event-related task designs'' \citep{finn2017can}.
%
``Naturalistic paradigms do not aim to replace the classic, controlled
neuroimaging paradigms (Sonkusare et al., 2019). Due to their complexity and
current limitations in understanding the statistical properties of different
features in naturalistic conditions, naturalistic stimuli are not optimal for
model development [see, e.g., Rust and Movshon, 2005]. Controlled experiments
are still needed for hypothesis testing and developing models, while
naturalistic stimuli are best employed to test models in ecologically valid
settings and to expand them to situations where context matters
more'' \citep{saarimaki2021naturalistic}.
