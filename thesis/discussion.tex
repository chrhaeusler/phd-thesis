``Future studies that aim to use a movie to localize visual areas in individual
participants should extensively annotate the content of frames (e.g., using the
open-source solution ``Pliers''\citep{mcnamara2017developing} for feature
extraction from a visual naturalistic stimulus)''
\citep{haeusler2022processing}.
%
However, I did not test quality/reliability of individual results depending on
quantity of runs to assess naturalistic stimulus as potential replacement;

%
Our modeling approach is pretty similar because adopted from classical
paradigms.

%
Modeling was shitty (especially in AV);
%
still results suggest: the response to spatial information must be somewhere in
there

\section{Naturalistic stimuli}

\subsection{Pro naturalistic stimuli}

\todo[inline]{annotations are hard but you can do it}

\todo[inline]{traditional GLM ``works''}

%
``Compared with functional localizers, naturalistic stimuli provide several
advantages such as stronger and widespread brain activation, greater engagement,
and increased subject compliance'' \citep{jiahui2020predicting}.

\subsection{Contra naturalistic stimuli}

%
Just an approximation.
%
Setting is still the scanner.
%
Passive watching \& listening. Hence, executive functions?
%
Challenging data data analysis, but create \& share annotation.
%
Implement data analysis pipelines in common and well-documented packages and
code, and share it along the paper.


\section{Open, transparent, and reproducible science}

\todo[inline]{cf. general introduction}

\subsection{Data re-use for new investigation \& new results}


\todo[inline]{mih: du hast mit dem PPA paper eine Publikation in SciData, weil
du separate und unabhängig veröffentlichte Daten, durch zusätzliche, von der
erstellte Werte, ganz neu betrachten und interpretieren konntest}

\todo[inline]{Du zeigst damit, dass die Idee studyforrest erfolgreich sein kann}



\subsection{Reproducibility \& sharing}

\todo[inline]{mih: Datenveröffentlichungen nochmal hervorheben; Code repos mit
ausführbaren Analysen hervorheben; du hast die von dir gesetzten Ziele auch
erreicht}


\subsubsection{Pro}

\todo[inline]{Du bist daher in der Lage in persönliches Fazit zu ziehen: was hat
es der Wissenschaft gebracht, dass diese Daten "schon da waren"; Was hat es dir
gebracht? Was war schwerer als wenn du die Daten selbst erhoben hättest? Was
wäre dann aber nicht möglich gewesen.}


\subsubsection{Contra}

\todo[inline]{my project is using existing data; new investigation; new results}

%
It takes fuckin time with just minor immediate contrubtion to the workflow.
%
That is especially the cause because it is not standard yet (established tools
of trade?); it is not taught in study programmes (but needs to be standard).
Thus it is an added ``burden'' during PhD thesis.
%
People who do not give a shit about it and don't do it, do ``worse'' research
but are faster/``better''.

%
Opportunity costs. It is not just about the raw data but also about
preprocessing, templates, results of the localizer. For other persons, its also
my speech annotation; we had no mask for RSC und transverse occipital sulcus.
%
Hence, do everything possible to make it really, really good 'cause other people
will rely on your shit.

%
Vice versa: Can you trust published data? Balance of checking everything vs.
taking things for granted.
%
The unknown unknowns of dataset creators? What did they fail to consider?
Standards may vary depending on the use case. Assume that everything that is not
explicitly stated in a paper along the dataset was not done?


\section{Clinical Application}

``Although there is no one-to-one mapping between brain region and cognitive
process [3], functional localization has proven to be of direct practical use
[4–5]. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is one non-invasive method
allowing to localize brain functions with limited but nevertheless remarkable
detail [6]. In the clinical context, fMRI plays an important role for planning
surgery in patients with tumors or epilepsies, as it aids the understanding of
which parts of the brain need to be spared in order to preserve sensory, motor
or cognitive abilities [Stippich C. Introduction to Presurgical Functional
MRI. In: Clinical Functional MRI. Springer Berlin Hei- delberg; 2015. p. 1–7.]''
\citep{wegrzyn2018thought}.

``To be useful for clinical diagnostics and prognostics, fMRI data must be
interpretable on the level of the individual case [8]. Because in group studies
idiosyncratic activity patterns can be obscured by averaging, the precise
mapping of brain function in a single person has become a vanguard of fMRI
research [9–11]. These studies are important to deepen our understanding of how
the brain works, because the functional organization of brains becomes more
heterogeneous on a finer anatomical scale [9,12]. Also, when looking at
increasingly smaller ‘regions of the mind’, such as the neural correlates of
specific words instead of language in general, averaging on the group level can
obscure the fine spatial information which allows to differentiate these
contents in the individual brain [10]. Single participant studies can also
provide valuable impulses for the use of fMRI as a clinical tool. This includes
the possibility to assess how stable results are within a single participant,
and how much data should be collected to provide a reliable description of the
individual’s functional brain organization [9,11]. While the group average is a
composite of many individuals, the activity map of the individual is likewise a
composite of an underlying time course, consisting of many separate
observations of brain activity while performing a task. Variability over the
course of an fMRI session can be expected due to factors such as head movement,
fatigue, increasing familiarity with the task and changes in cognitive
strategies [13–14]. The neuroradiologist’s interpretation of a single
patient’s fMRI might therefore be substantially improved, if she knows how the
patient’s cognitive states changed over time and how this relates to changes in
brain activity patterns. This is particularly important if no overt behavior
is collected during the fMRI task. For example, in a language production task,
patients might be asked to produce words from categories such as “fruits” or
“animals” in a pre- defined period of time [15]. Because overt articulation of
words produces movement artifacts, the patients might be asked to use only
internal speech. Without behavioral output from the patient, interpretation of
fMRI results is limited by the uncertainty about whether the task was performed
in the expected manner'' \citep{wegrzyn2018thought}.

\section{Conclusion}
%
In summary, naturalistic stimuli ``impose a meaningful timecourse across
subjects while still allowing for individual variation in brain activity and
behavioral responses, and lend themselves to a broader set of analyses than
either pure rest or pure event-related task designs'' \citep{finn2017can}.
%
``Naturalistic paradigms do not aim to replace the classic, controlled
neuroimaging paradigms (Sonkusare et al., 2019). Due to their complexity and
current limitations in understanding the statistical properties of different
features in naturalistic conditions, naturalistic stimuli are not optimal for
model development (see, e.g., Rust and Movshon, 2005). Controlled experiments
are still needed for hypothesis testing and developing models, while
naturalistic stimuli are best employed to test models in ecologically valid
settings and to expand them to situations where context matters
more'' \citep{saarimaki2021naturalistic}.
