\todo[inline]{Intro is still pretty similar to phrasing in introduction}

Human brain mapping studies have traditionally averaged \ac{fmri} data across
participants.
%
However, data need to be assessed on the level of individual persons in order to
advance the field towards a clinical application.
% functional localizer
A promising tool to perform that step are functional localizers [because
localizers aim to characterize the location size, and shape of functional areas
on the level of individual subject].
% contra localizers
However, traditional localizer paradigms employ selectively sampled,
tightly-controlled stimuli, rely heavily on a participant's compliance, and can
usually map just one domain of brain functions
% naturalistic stimuli could replace
Localizer paradigm based on naturalistic stimuli could provide higher ecological
as well as external validity, higher data quality due to increased compliance,
and potentially map a variety of brain functions [ranging from low-level
perception (e.g., luminance) to high-level cognition (e.g., social cognition)]
simultaneously.
% visually impaired
Lastly, an exclusively auditory stimulus like an audiobook or audio drama would
also be appropriate for visually impaired persons, e.g., suffering from
nystagmus or lack of eyesight.
% PPA as proof of concept
The current thesis focused on the \ac{ppa}, a classic higher-visual area,
\citep{epstein1998ppa}, in order to explore whether a movie and the movie's
audio-description could, in principle, substitute a traditional localizer
paradigm.

\paragraph{Open science}
% intro
The self-imposed, overarching goal of this dissertation was to perform all three
studies under the principles of open, accessible, shared, and transparent
science.
% mention Datalad
To meet the requirements of a reproducible research project and facilitate
replication of findings in prospective studes all created data, written code,
results are published as standardized and version-controlled DataLad
\citep[\href{www.datalad.org}{datalad.org};][]{halchenko2021datalad} datasets.
% datalad rerun
Consequently, independent researchers can re-run all analyses and validate the
results.


\section{Recapitulation of work packages}

\todo[inline]{maybe, give an overview of how the upcoming part is structured:
study as such, study in light of open science, general assessment of open
science, conclusion on naturalistic stimuli as localizer, conclusion on
naturalistic stimuli in general}

%
First, we extended the studyforrest dataset (study 1).
%
Second  and similarly to traditional localizer paradigms, we modeled hemodynamic
activity based on annotated stimulus features embedded in the movie ``Forrest
Gump'' and its audio-description, and created GLM $t$-contrasts in order to
locate the \ac{ppa} (study 2).
%
Third, we estimated results of the localizer by projecting data through a
\ac{cfs} (study 3).


\subsection{Speech anno}

\subsubsection{goal of speech anno}

\subsubsection{discussion of speech anno paper}

\subsubsection{speech anno paper in light of open science}

% intro
Lack of annotation is a ``bottleneck'' \citep{aliko2020naturalistic}
% goal of annotation
Therefore, one subgoal was to widen that bottleneck and extend studyforrest
project (\href{www.studyforrest.org}{\url{studyforrest.org}} with an annotation
of speech.
% more done than necessary for current thesis
The annotation has been published in an open peer-reviewed open-access journal
\citep{haeusler2021speechanno}.
%
The annotation provides information about the two stimuli's time-courses that
goes beyond / exceeds the information that was necessary to perform the current
thesis.
%
Therefore, widens the ``annotation bottleneck'' and potentially lays
the foundation for independent research projects.
%
This extension is standardized and available as online repositories comprising
raw data, code, and results.

\paragraph{personal assessment}

\todo[inline]{how "personal" am I supposed to get?}

%
Much take and effort was taken to create a really good 'cause you do not know
what people will use it for.
%
Realization: there is no "perfect" annotation due to ambiguities, noise or
whatever.
%
Find a balance: do the mere minimum (raw) or do some additional work (e.g.,
semantics) that might not be ``perfect'', might be based of models that are
"outdated" a couple of years later, or do not necessarily meet the
requirements of specific use cases in terms of semantic analyses.

%
\todo[inline]{I could write here or in the summary of "open science stuff"
across all studies that I pulled my hair out while searching for inconsistencies
in the timings, and found that the audio track of the audio-description is
essentially unsystematically shifted}

%
It is hard to anticipate potential use-cases.



\subsection{PPA paper}

\subsubsection{goal of PPA paper}

\subsubsection{discussion of speech anno paper}

\todo[inline]{phrase more clearly: we = event-related; localizers = block}

%
We extended the annotation for our specific use case:
%
model hemodynamic responses were modeled based on the event structure as
similarly performed in traditional block-design localizer paradigms.


\paragraph{Results: traditional GLM ``works''}
%
Despite exploratory approach (a.k.a. shitty modeling of subjectively assessed
events), results suggest:
%
the response to spatial information must be somewhere in there and is
detectable.


\subsubsection{Future studies on PPA}

Results invite prospective studies employing dedicated stimuli.
%
I did not test the reliability of individual results
depending on quantity of runs to assess naturalistic stimulus as potential
replacement [because SRM study].


\subsubsection{Other scene-selective areas}

\todo[inline]{cf. reviewer response of PPA study}


\subsubsection{Future studies: other functional areas}

\todo[inline]{cf. discussion of SRM part}

We focused on the \ac{ppa} as a proof-of-concept.


\paragraph{Studyforrest dataset}
%
Other mask of functional areas in studyforrest dataset (e.g. for master or
bachelor thesis, or as part of a PhD project).
%
``Future studies that aim to use a movie to localize visual areas in individual
participants should extensively annotate the content of frames (e.g., using the
open-source solution ``Pliers''\citep{mcnamara2017developing} for feature
extraction from a visual naturalistic stimulus)''
\citep{haeusler2022processing}.


\paragraph{New dataset}
%
An independent dataset comprising naturalistic stimulation and (a variety
of) localizers.
%
A full feature film might substitute traditional localizer paradigms dedicated
localizer by mapping a variety of brain functions beyond category-specific
visual areas.


\subsubsection{Future studies: inter-individual differences / variability}
%
Compared to the visual \ac{ppa}, we observe more variability of the auditory
\ac{ppa} across subjects.


\paragraph{Theory: outliers are not necessarily noise}
%
``Divergent patterns of brain organization from the most common pattern (that
is, changes in the spatial arrangement of cortical regions) can be observed in
approximately 5â€“10\% of the healthy population [Glasser, 2016, A multi-modal
parcellation; Gordon, 2017, Individual variability], and care should therefore
be taken to avoid the undue influence of such outliers''
\citep{eickhoff2018imaging}.
%
``Topological outliers, if they do not result from artefacts, can also be
considered to be interesting cases of inter-individual variability to understand
brain-phenotype relationships [Zilles (2013). Individual variability is not
noise]'' \citep{eickhoff2018imaging}.
%
``Recent studies have suggested that the topography (location and size) of
individual-specific brain parcellations is predictive of individual differences
in demographics, cognition, emotion and personality [Bijsterbosch (2018). The
relationship between spatial configuration and functional connectivity; Kong
(2018). Spatial topography of individual-specific cortical networks predicts
human cognition, personality and emotion; Salehi (2017), An exemplar-based
approach to individualized parcellation reveals the need for sex specific
functional networks]'' \citep{eickhoff2018imaging}.
%
``Only by understanding the generic characteristic of topographic organization
can we start to appreciate idiosyncrasies and their relationships to
socio-demographic, cognitive or affective profiles''
\citep{eickhoff2018imaging}.


\paragraph{Question regarding our results}
%
Do we find more variability due to naturalistic stimulation ("more random
sampling") and our (adventurous) modeling approach of spatial information or due
to auditory spatial information per se.
%
Possible reasons include individual alertness/fatigue, attentional focus,
different predisposition to ``select'' or processing spatial relevant
information differently.


\paragraph{Brain \& behavior}
%
``Interindividual variability of functional regions in both functional and
spatial features should reflect brain function to some extent, and thus is a
rich and important source of information for revealing the neural basis of human
cognition and behavior [Kanai (2011). The structural basis of inter-individual
differences in human behaviour and cognition; Zilles (2013). Individual
variability is not noise]'' \citep{zhen2015quantifying}.
%
Future studies need to elaborate on the significance of the variability of
functional regions and utilize this variability to explore the neural mechanisms
of specific behavioral or cognitive processes [Van Horn (2008). Individual
variability in brain activity: a nuisance or an opportunity?]''
\citep{zhen2015quantifying}.

%
``The spatial and selectivity variability of the SSRs may likely underlie
individual differences in navigation, especially when scene perception is being
utilized'' \citep{zhen2017quantifying}.
%
For example, processing oral way description and using it for planing,
remembering, executing navigation.

%
Further studies using dedicated auditory localizer should shed light on the
inter-individual differences of persons exhibiting an auditory \ac{ppa}.
%
``Future studies will be needed to elaborate on the mechanism and functional
significance of the interindividual variability of the SSRs and to utilize the
variability in understanding the neural mechanisms of scene perception [Kanai
(2011). The structural basis of inter-individual differences in human behaviour
and cognition; Van Horn (2008). Individual variability in brain activity: a
nuisance or an opportunity?]'' \citep{zhen2017quantifying}.
%
Our study ``invites future work on the origin of the variability and its
relation to individual differences in behavioral performance''
\citep{zhen2015quantifying}.



\subsubsection{PPA paper in light of open science}

% goal PPA study
Under the perspective of an open science project, one goal of study 2 was to use
already existing data of the studyforrest project and extend the published
annotation for the specific needs of a new research question.
%
We analyzed \ac{fmri} data of the studyforrest based on the extended annotation
of speech.
%
Thus, we were able to interpret the data under a new perspective that was not
foreseen during the original generation of the studyforrest project.
%
Our results suggesting that the PPA is fucking awesome have been published in a
peer-reviewed, open-access journal \citep{haeusler2022processing}.

%
Consequently, we successfully reused existing data as a foundation for a new
investigation in order to generate novel findings that illustrate the benefits
of publicly and freely available dataset like the studyforrest project.


\paragraph{personal assessment}

%
Opportunity costs [look up definition]: One example of the current thesis is the
analyses performed by \citet{sengupta2016extension} that were performed (and
published) in voxel-space (not surface-space) and resulting masks were
restricted to one scene-selective area (\ac{ppa}; no \ac{rsc}, \ac{opa} =
transverse occipital sulcus).








\subsection{SRM study}

% align left-out subject
Based on our findings in study 2 \citep{haeusler2022processing}, we assumed that
the event structure in both naturalistic stimuli would correlate, among others,
with brain responses that are similar to those correlating with the event
structure in a dedicated functional localizer.








\section{Open Science: summary, personal assessment, conclusion}


\subsection{Contra}

\paragraph{Not required, not established}
%
Following the guidelines was not mandatory for submitting the thesis but
constituted voluntary, additional careful work.
%
The additional benefits that go along this additional work are not immediately
visible to researchers/authors.
%
Further, the standards to follow are still emerging and [probably] not yet
standardized [?].
%
Guidelines are not [yet] part of a curriculum, neither in a bachelor's/master's
program nor PhD program and therefore self-imposed and learned based on
self-initiative.


\paragraph{Additional workload}
%
Take extra care to make everything really, really good 'cause other people will
rely on your shit.
%
You have to make your data and script extra pretty so other people can benefit
from your work but you do not benefit yourself from doing more than is necessary
for your own project.
%
Thus it is an added ``burden'' during PhD thesis.

%
People who do not give a shit about it and don't do it, do ``worse'' research
but are faster/``better''.


\paragraph{Science is competition; data leeching}
%
Other working groups (more money, brain/people power) can be faster and can use
your data for similar findings.


\subsection{Trustful data?}

%
Dataset will never be perfect and will contain noise, or even artefacts.
%
Data description need to be as exhaustive as possible.
%
Re-users need to check the data according to their use case!
%
The unknown unknowns of dataset creators?
%
Quality standards vary from field to field and even within subfields of
neuroscience (a.k.a. ``interessiert uns ja nicht'').
%
Everything that is not explicitly stated needs to be assumed to not be
considered.
%
Which is consequently leading to opportunity costs:


\subsection{Opportunity costs: raw data}

Wikipedia: ``opportunity cost of a particular activity is the value or benefit
given up by engaging in that activity, relative to engaging in an alternative
activity.
%
More simply, it means if you chose one activity (for example, an investment) you
are giving up the opportunity to do a different option.
%
The optimal activity is the one that, net of its opportunity cost, provides the
greater return compared to any other activities, net of their opportunity
costs''.

%
You save time and money (especially if you do not collect the data yourself) but
you have to trust that the data are ``good'' and start at some point to reach
goals that you would not accomplished if you would have done all from scratch
(i.e. preprocessing).
%
On the one hand, not spending time on collecting data is speeding up the process
of getting to analyze the data, and go beyond what would have been possible if
you would have collected the data yourself.
%
On the other hand, there is an hard to judge ``correct'' balance between
trusting the work of others that collected the raw data, and checking the data
and familiarize yourself with the data.
%
Researchers need to handle that two-sided sword and balance trusting the
creators of the dataset and checking/validating everything themselves.

%
This essentially boils down to researchers that want to publish data to highly
take care that the dataset gets really, really good, and test and validate the
data substantially and rigorously.
%
Contingencies need to be taken care of and use-cases considered/anticipated that
go beyond the originally anticipated use-cases (``a.k.a. interessiert uns ja
nicht'').

%
The same applies not just for the collection of raw data but also any
preprocessing steps, (that might lead to different results based on parameters,
operation system, software version etc.) or any kind of results.
%
Standardizing the analyses pipelines helps.
%
Nevertheless, there is no "one size fits all" uses-cases.
%
Hence, being able to re-run analyses with custom parameters for specific
use-cases helps
%
In summary, it is mandatory to create awareness, and teach established and
emerging standards to students.

\todo[inline]{Why was is good for science that the data were already existing?}

\todo[inline]{Why was is good for you that the data were already existing?}

From introduction:
% reproducibility crisis
Over the last decade, there has been a growing awareness that results of
scientific publications are not reproducible or general scientific findings are
not replicable letting some authors speak of a ``reproducibility crisis'' or
``replication crisis'' in the sciences \citep{baker2016reproducibility,
plesser2018reproducibility, stupple2019reproducibility, nosek2022replicability}.
% reproducibility: definition
``A study is reproducible if all of the code and data used to generate the
numbers and figures in the paper are available and exactly produce the published
results'' \citep{leek2017most}.
% replicability: definition
A study is replicable if the same analysis of an equivalent experiment's data
leads to consistent results \citep{dubois2016building, leek2017most}.


\section{Conclusion: Naturalistic stimuli as functional localizer}

\subsubsection{Caveats of naturalistic stimuli}
%
Challenging data data analysis, but create \& share annotation.
%
Hence, data analysis pipelines should be implemented in common and
well-documented packages and code, and custom code shared along the paper.

%
Just an approximation of real life.
%
Setting is still the scanner.
%
Passive watching \& listening.
%
Executive functions?


\section{Conclusion: naturalistic stimuli in general)}
%
Naturalistic stimuli are not a panacea but traditional paradigms and
naturalistic paradigms should be used in tandem / reciprocally to generate new
hypotheses and progress our understanding of the brain.


%
In summary, naturalistic stimuli ``impose a meaningful timecourse across
subjects while still allowing for individual variation in brain activity and
behavioral responses, and lend themselves to a broader set of analyses than
either pure rest or pure event-related task designs'' \citep{finn2017can}.
%
``Naturalistic paradigms do not aim to replace the classic, controlled
neuroimaging paradigms (Sonkusare et al., 2019). Due to their complexity and
current limitations in understanding the statistical properties of different
features in naturalistic conditions, naturalistic stimuli are not optimal for
model development [see, e.g., Rust and Movshon, 2005]. Controlled experiments
are still needed for hypothesis testing and developing models, while
naturalistic stimuli are best employed to test models in ecologically valid
settings and to expand them to situations where context matters
more'' \citep{saarimaki2021naturalistic}.
