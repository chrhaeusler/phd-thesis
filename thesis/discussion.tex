From OHBM-Abstract: vgl. long abstract in doc-file
%
The present results are evidence that a functionally de ned region, such as the
PPA, can be localized using a complex natural stimulus, by exploiting its
inherent temporal structure with respect to a particular hypothesized cognitive
or perceptual function.
%
While natural stimulation is not a universal solution, it can represent one
approach to overcome the threat of lacking generalizability associated with
small and simpli ed stimulus sets.
%
Using this approach we replicate a previous nding of PPA modulation by verbal
stimuli with descriptions of spatial con gurations.
%
This adds to the evidence that the PPA is not exclusively involved in visual
processing, but a bilateral anterior portion also exhibits activation increases
correlated with the semantic processing of verbal statements of spatial
references in a rich natural auditory stimulus.

\todo[inline]{repeat the usual stuff}

\todo[inline]{annotations are hard but you can do it}

\todo[inline]{traditional GLM ``works''}


\paragraph{contra}
%
just an approximation;
%
setting is still the scanner;
%
passive watching, listening: executive functions?
%
challenging data data analysis;
%
solutions -> share annotations,
%
implement data analysis pipelines in common and well-documented packages and code


\paragraph{interim summary}

``Naturalistic paradigms do not aim to replace the classic, controlled
neuroimaging paradigms (Sonkusare et al., 2019). Due to their complexity and
current limitations in understanding the statistical properties of different
features in naturalistic conditions, naturalistic stimuli are not optimal for
model development (see, e.g., Rust and Movshon, 2005). Controlled experiments
are still needed for hypothesis testing and developing models, while
naturalistic stimuli are best employed to test models in ecologically valid
settings and to expand them to situations where context matters
more'' \citep{saarimaki2021naturalistic}.

\section{Future research}

\paragraph{Other functional areas}

Again, data from the studyforrest project will be used to perform assessments
analog to WP1e for a range of additional individually determined regions based
on established localizer paradigms (Sengupta, et al., 2016).
%
These regions include: the \ac{ffa}, \ac{ppa}, and \ac{eba}  which are
associated with face perception \citep{kanwisher1997ffa,
pitcher2011occipitalfacearea}, scene perception \citep{epstein1998ppa}, and the
perception of human bodies \citep{downing2001bodyarea}, respectively.


\paragraph{connectivity based hyperalignment?}
%
It should be noted that the number of voxels that can be considered
simultaneously for functional BOLD response time series alignment is limited by
the number of timepoints in the calibration scan (about 300-400 voxels for a
15min scan with a 2s TR, corresponding to a local cortical neighborhood of about
1cm in diameter for a standard resolution).
%
This limitation does not exist in this form for a functional alignment that is
based on connectivity vectors.
%
The length of these connectivity vectors is determined by the number of
reference (or seed) regions in the brain.


\section{Vision}
%
Moreover, beyond the scope of this project the targeted homogenization of
acquisition procedures will further the goal of large scale data collection for
the purpose of producing a normative reference of brain function as measured by
fMRI.
%
The availability of such a reference would enable quantitative and qualitative
description of an individual's brain function with respect to such a norm, and
consequently progress the field towards neuroimaging studies of individual
differences that more closely resemble their psychological counterparts
\citep{dubois2016building}.
