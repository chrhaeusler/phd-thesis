\section{Introduction}

% higher visual areas higher visual areas
In the domain of higher-visual perception, functionally defined,
category-selective brain regions like the \ac{ppa} \citep{epstein1998ppa}, the
\ac{ffa} \citep{kanwisher1997ffa}, or \ac{eba} \citep{downing2001bodyarea}
exhibit significantly increased \ac{bold} activity correlated with a
``preferred'' \citep{debeck2008interpreting} stimulus class.


\todo[inline]{cite paper here that do not (just) investigate PPA}

% example: higher functional areas
The ``topographies of these category-selective areas are mostly distributed
similarly across individuals, but great individual variability exists in the
locus, the size, and the shape of the category-selective areas
[\citep{rosenke2021probabilistic, zhen2017quantifying, zhen2015quantifying,
frost2012measuring}]'' [still similar phrasing to\citep{jiahui2020predicting}].
% localizer
In order to identify functional areas in individual persons, block-design
\textit{functional localizer} paradigms are traditionally used that contrast
regressors representing modeled hemodynamic responses to presented stimulus
classes (i.e. landscapes, faces or bodies).

\todo[inline]{cite papers here that only investigate variability of PPA}

% PPA as example
For example, \citep{rosenke2021probabilistic, weiner2018defining,
zhen2017quantifying} have shown that the awesome \ac{ppa}...


\paragraph{Problem: domain-specific and fucking boring}

% problem: one localizer for one domain
However, functional localizers are designed to maximize detection power and thus
dedicated to map just one domain of brain functions, for example, retinotopic
visual areas \citep{wang2015probabilistic}, scene-selective regions
\citep{stigliani2015temporal}, theory of mind \citep{spunt2014validating}, or
semantic processes \citep{fernandez2001language}.
% which gets messy
Consequently, if one wants to map a variety of domains, the approach ``one
paradigm for one domain of functions'' gets time-consuming and inefficient.

\todo[inline]{maybe cut part on localizer batteries 'cause it's in the general
intro already}

% localizer batteries: intro
Researchers have tried to tackle that issue by creating time-efficient
multi-functional \textit{localizer batteries} \citep[e.g.,][]{barch2013function,
drobyshevsky2006rapid, pinel2007fast}.

% task based = shit
Nevertheless, the diagnostic quality of localizer batteries relies heavily on
a participant's comprehension of the task instructions and general compliance,
a criterion that can be difficult to meet in clinical or pediatric populations.


\paragraph{what we have done in study 1 \& 2}

\todo[inline]{phrasing (too) similar to general intro \& smooth it}
%
In study 2 \citep{haeusler2022processing}, we have shown that a functionally
defined region, such as the \ac{ppa}, can be localized using a model-driven
\ac{glm} analysis that is based on the annotated temporal structure of a
two-hour long naturalistic stimulus.
%
Results also suggest that a naturally engaging, purely auditory paradigm like an
audio-description could, in principle, substitute a visual localizer as a
diagnostic procedure to assess brain functions in visually impaired individuals
\citep{haeusler2022processing}.
%
However, a two-hour long paradigm is unsuitable for a clinical application due
to practical and monetary reasons.


\subsection{Therefore: estimate that shit}

% solution: predict from reference
An approach to reduce time and costs of individual diagnostics is to identify a
functional area in an individual person based on data collected from an
independent sample of different persons (i.e. a \textit{reference group}).

\subsubsection{Anatomical alignment}

\todo[inline]{cite just the best paper that did it}
%
A traditional procedure \citep{frost2012measuring, weiner2018defining,
zhen2017quantifying, zhen2015quantifying, rosenke2021probabilistic,
wang2015probabilistic} to estimate the most probable location of a functional
area in a person's anatomy from a reference group performs --- in order to
resolve anatomical variability across persons --- an \textit{anatomical
alignment}:
%
functional data from persons in the reference group are aligned to (i.e.
projected into) a \textit{common anatomical space}, and then projected from the
common anatomical space into the individual person's brain anatomy.
% volume-based
Volume-based anatomical alignment \citep[s.][for a review]{klein2009evaluation}
aligns voxel-wise data of individuals to a three-dimensional brain template
\citep[e.g., MNI152 template;][]{fonov2011unbiased}.
% surface-based
Surface-based anatomical alignment \citep{fischl1999cortical} aligns vertex-wise
data of individuals to a two-dimensional template \citep[e.g., FreeSurfer
fsaverage template;][]{fischl1999high}.

rosenke2021probabilistic} the variability in \textit{functional--anatomical

\citep{feilong2018reliable}, across persons.


\subsubsection{Functional alignment}

\todo[inline]{stream line phrasing}

\todo[inline]{mih: This is too dense.}

\todo[inline]{mih: Mixes "what is functional alignment" with what is a CFS with
how to align (but only linearly, i.e. with a matrix).}

\todo[inline]{It needs to mention at least "rotation" and must provide some
conceptual idea on what is being aligned, if it is not the 3D space of the
anatomy.}

\todo[inline]{Maybe reintroduce "CFS" (comes out of the blue)}

% intro
Since anatomical alignment addresses the issue of anatomical variability but
does not resolve the issue of functional-anatomical variability across subjects,
algorithms --- like \textit{hyperalignment} \citep{haxby2011common,
guntupalli2016model} or the \textit{shared response model}
\citep{chen2015reduced, zhang2016searchlight} --- have been developed that
perform a \textit{functional alignment} to a \textit{\ac{cfs}}.
%
Functional alignment does not align voxels (or surface vertices) that share the
same anatomical location but voxels that share similar functional properties in
order to preserve functional idiosyncrasies across persons.
%
In general, functional alignment algorithms are usually used to construct both a
\ac{cfs} (serving as ``a high-dimensional, functional brain template'') as well
as subject-specific transformation matrices.

\todo[inline]{Here it is conceptual, maybe just "transformation"?}
%
A subject's transformation matrix can be used to project functional data from a
subject's anatomical space into the \ac{cfs}, or to project data from the
\ac{cfs} into a subject's anatomical space \citep{haxby2020hyperalignment}.
%
The construction of the \ac{cfs} and transformation matrix can be created (i.e.
\textit{trained}) based on the maximization of the inter-subject similarity of
\ac{bold} response time series correlating with a time-locked external
stimulation \citep{haxby2011common, chen2015reduced, sabuncu2010function}, or
based on the inter-subject similarity of connectivity profiles
\citep{feilong2018reliable, guntupalli2018computational, nastase2019leveraging}.
%
Functional alignment algorithms can be applied to \ac{fmri} data from paradigms
employing simplified stimuli.
%
However, it has been shown that data from naturalistic stimuli provide increased
validity of the \ac{cfs} and increased generalizability of transformation
matrices to novel stimuli or tasks, presumably because naturalistic stimuli
sample a broader range of brain states \citep{haxby2011common,
guntupalli2016model}.


\subsubsection{Estimation via functional alignment}

%
Hence, a more promising procedure to estimate the most probable location of a
functional area in a person's anatomy from a reference group performs --- in
order to resolve functional-anatomical variability across persons --- an
functional alignment:
%
functional data from persons in the reference group are aligned to (i.e.
projected into) a \ac{cfs}, and then projected from the \ac{cfs} into the
individual person's brain anatomy.


\paragraph{studies that estimated functional areas using functional alignment}

% intro
Previous studies \citep{jiahui2020predicting, guntupalli2016model,
haxby2011common} that employed hyperalignment have shown that a subject's
idiosyncratic retinotopy of occipital areas and functional topography of
category-selective areas in the ventral temporal cortex can be estimated by
projecting data of a reference group through a \ac{cfs} into that subject's
cortical anatomy.
% used stimuli and length
For example, \citep{jiahui2020predicting} constructed a \ac{cfs} and
transformation matrices based on data from a) the movie ``Grand Budapest Hotel''
($\sim$\unit[50]{m}; \ac{tr}=\unit[1]{s}), and b) ``Forrest Gump''
($\sim$\unit[120]{m}; \ac{tr}=\unit[2]{s}).
% summary of results
Results revealed that the empirical results of a statistical contrasts aimed to
localize the \ac{ffa} correlate more highly with maps that were estimated from
other subjects' data based on hyperalignment than with maps that were estimated
based on surface-based, anatomical alignment \citep{jiahui2020predicting}.


\subsection{Here, we... (includes SRM now)}

\citet{dubois2018resting} on out-of-sample prediction: ``Second, most studies
have failed to use a predictive or replication framework ([but see Deris,
Montag, Reuter, Weber, \& Markett, 2017], making their generalizability
unclear—a well-recognized problem in neuroscience studies of individual
differences [Dubois \& Adolphs, 2016; Gabrieli, Ghosh, \& Whitfield- Gabrieli,
2015; Yarkoni \& Westfall, 2017]. The present paper takes these two challenges
seriously by applying a predictive framework, together with a built-in
replication, to a large, homogeneous resting-state fMRI data set. We chose to
focus on resting-state fMRI data to predict personality, because this is a
predictor that could have better mechanistic interpretation than structural MRI
measures (since ultimately it is brain function, not structure, that generates
the behavior on the basis of which we can infer personality)''.


\paragraph{Intro}

\todo[inline]{add sentences about "auditory PPA"}

\todo[inline]{Emphasize more that this is not just a binary prediction.}

% summary in one sentence
Here, we focus on the \ac{ppa} as an example of a functional area, and estimate
results (statistical $Z$-maps) of a visual localizer's $t$-contrast in one
subject (i.e. the \textit{test subject}) based on data from other subjects (i.e.
the \textit{training subjects}).
%
Results of our previous study \citep{haeusler2022processing} suggest that not
just the dedicated visual localizer \citep{sengupta2016extension} but also the
audio-visual movie Forrest Gump \citep{hanke2016simultaneous} and the movie's
audio-description \citep{hanke2014audiomovie} sample the response vector space
of hemodynamic responses to ``spatial information'' in a time-locked manner
across subjects.

\todo[inline]{Very dense. This could be a full paragraph}
%
Hence, following a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation procedure, we employed
both a procedure using a volume-based, anatomical alignment as well as a
procedure using a volume-based, functional alignment in order to predict
$z$-values within a \ac{roi}.


from \citet{wang2015probabilistic}: ``Leave-one-out validation. To validate the
FPM for use with novel subjects, we calculated the central tendency metric (see
above) between ROIs in the FPM and ROIs defined in single-subjects. For each
subject, we regenerated the FPM (and MPM, see below) after first excluding that
subject from the atlas generation procedure. We then calculated the central
tendency metric between every ROI in the leave-one-out FPM with every
subject-specific ROI. To assess significance, we compared the mean central
tendency across subjects for the corresponding ROIs in the subject-specific
space and the leave-one-out FPM with the central tendency for all other FPM
ROIs.
%
To validate the MPM for use with novel subjects, we compared the proportion of
overlap between ROIs in the leave-one-out MPM and ROIs defined in
single-subjects. Proportion overlap was determined with respect to (i.e., the
denominator) the volume of the subject-specific ROIs, although using the volume
of the MPM ROI yielded similar results. To assess significance, we com- pared
the mean overlap across subjects for corresponding ROIs in the MPM and the
subject-specific map with the overlap for all other subject-specific ROIs.  A
complementary analysis comparing overlap with the corresponding ROI and all
other ROIs in the MPM yielded similar results.


\paragraph{SRM}

\todo[inline]{This really needs some kind of schema, or math with proper
variable names etc.}

%
In case of the functional alignment procedure, we first applied the \ac{srm}
algorithm \citep{chen2015reduced, richard2019fast} to the training subjects'
\ac{bold} \ac{fmri} time series of the visual localizer and naturalistic
stimulus paradigms in order to derive a \ac{cfs} and subject-specific
transformation matrices.
%
The \ac{srm} is an unsupervised probabilistic latent-factor model that
decomposes \ac{bold} \ac{fmri} responses time series of participants
experiencing the same stimulus into a lower-dimensional space of shared features
(i.e. the \ac{cfs}) and subject-specific orthogonal topographic transformation
matrices \citep{kumar2020brainiak, cohen2017computational}.
%
The dimensions of the shared feature space do not correspond to individual
voxels but \textit{shared features} that can be understood as a weighted sum of
many voxels distributed across the full voxel space of each subject
\citep{kumar2020brainiak}.
%
In contrast to hyperalignment, the number of dimensions of the shared feature
space is not set by the number of voxels (or surface vertices) but is
pre-specified by the researcher, a procedure that also filters out noise and
reduces overfitting \citep{chen2015reduced}.

\todo[inline]{rephrase to better match our case}
% project into CFS
Second, we used the subject-specific transformation matrices in order to perform
a mapping of the visual localizer's results (i.e. the training subjects'
\textit{empirical $Z$-maps}) from each training subject's voxel space into the
\ac{cfs} (i.e. shared feature space).
% align test subject
Third, we use time series data from the naturalistic stimuli to align the test
subject to the \ac{cfs} (that was derived from the training subjects' data) in
order to acquire the test subject's transformation matrix.
% project from CFS into test subject
Last, the transpose of the test subject's transformation matrix is used to
project the training subjects' functional localizer results from the \ac{cfs}
into the test subject's voxel space serving as an estimation (hence, a
\textit{predicted $Z$-map}) of the test subject's localizer results (i.e. the
test subject's empirical $Z$-map).


\paragraph{partial alignment}

Given that a two-hour long stimulation is unsuitable for a clinical setting, we
critically also assess the relationship between the length of the naturalistic
stimulus used for alignment of the test subject to the fixed \ac{cfs} and the
subsequent estimation performance.
%
Therefore, we use an increasing number of segments of the naturalistic stimuli
(each lasting $\sim$\unit[15]{m}) to align the test subject to the corresponding
segments' time points within the \ac{cfs}.


\paragraph{model validation; within experiment estimation}

\todo[inline]{imo, it's too much to mention it here}
\todo[inline]{mention in methods; in results \& discussion, too?}

%
Hence, we also test alignment based on the first run (\unit[312]{s};
\unit[5.2]{m}) of data from the visual localizer to acquire the transformation
matrices and perform a cross-subject-prediction (vs.
cross-subject-cross-experiment-prediction).
%
Because: ``Between-subject models with SRM can, in some cases, exceed the
performance of within-subject models because (a) the reduced-dimension shared
space can highlight stimulus-related variance by filtering out noisy or
non-stimulus-related features, and (b) the between-subject model can effectively
leverage a larger volume of data after functional alignment than is available
for any single subject'' \citep{kumar2020brainiak}.


\subsection{Hypotheses}

\todo[inline]{draft; s. also general introduction}
%
We hypothesized that an increased quantity of data used to calculate the
transformation matrices of the test subjects would lead to an increasing
prediction performance.
%
Further, we hypothesized that functional alignment procedure would eventually
outperform an estimation based on anatomical alignment.


\subsection{Summary of results}

\todo[inline]{mih: seems like strange position for such a section. If, prior Hypotheses. No?}

Template from \citet{jiahui2020predicting}: ``Results show strong correlations
of face-selectivity topographic maps derived from a subject's own localizer data
with maps derived from other subjects' localizer data projected into that
subject's cortical anatomy. Both the two-step algorithm and the new one-step
algorithm, which we introduce here, produce high-fidelity, individualized
topographic maps, but the new one-step algorithm maps were superior''
\citep{jiahui2020predicting}.


\subsection{Vision}

\todo[inline]{cf. general introduction}

\todo[inline]{2-3 sentences are enough here; better write more in discussion}

Our results suggest that it is possible to ``scan once, estimate many''...

%
Template from \citet{jiahui2020predicting}'s introduction: ``Movies engage
multiple brain systems in parallel. From a single movie dataset multiple
functional topographies can be estimated \citep{guntupalli2016model}, whereas
different localizers are typically required to map different functional
topographies, making a thorough mapping of selective topographies time-consuming
and inefficient. Movies also simulate better the statistics of natural viewing
and listening and may provide more ecologically valid maps. [...] Naturalistic
stimuli may better sample the full range of responses to faces and other stimuli
that contribute to face-selective topographies'' \citep{jiahui2020predicting}.
%
``These results lay a foundation for building a computational tool with a
database that could allow others to map multiple functional topographies in new
subjects using only data collected during movie viewing. Functional localizers
are inefficient because they only estimate one or a few topographies for each
localizer. Movies, by contrast, engage in parallel multiple neural systems for
vision, audition, language, person perception, social cognition, and other
functions. Consequently, movies have the potential to estimate selective
topographies in all of these domains. Such a tool would require a database of
data for movies and a range of functional localizers in a normative group of
subjects. A new subject's functional topographies could be estimated based only
on that subject's movie data and other subjects' localizer data from the
normative database that could be projected into that subject's cortical anatomy
using hyperalignment transformation matrices derived from movie data. Such a
resource would be more efficient and replace tedious functional localizers with
an engaging movie and could enable mapping of multiple functional topographies
with data from a single fMRI using a naturalistic stimulus''

\subsection{Preprocessing}

% data sources
The current analyses were carried out on the same preprocessed fMRI data (s.
\href{https://github.com/psychoinformatics-de/studyforrest-data-aligned
}{\url{github.com/psychoinformatics-de/studyforrest-data-aligned}}) that were
used for
%
a) the technical validation of the dataset \citep{hanke2016simultaneous},
%
b) the localization of higher-visual areas \citep{sengupta2016extension}, and
%
c) the investigation of responses of the \ac{ppa} correlating with naturalistic
spatial information in study 2 \citep{haeusler2022processing}.

%
We reran the preprocessing and analyses steps performed in
\citet{sengupta2016extension} and \citet{haeusler2022processing} using FEAT
v6.00 \citep[FMRI Expert Analysis Tool;][]{woolrich2001autocorr} as shipped with
FSL v5.0.9 \citep[\href{https://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl}{FMRIB's Software
Library;}][]{smith2004fsl} in order to reproduce both the time series that
served as final input for the statistical analyses in the two previous studies
as well as their results (i.e. the statistical $Z$-maps).
% temporal filtering
In summary, high-pass temporal filtering was applied using a Gaussian-weighted
least-squares straight line to every run of the visual localizer (cutoff period
of \unit[100]{s}; sigma= \unit[100]{s}/2)[???], and every segment of the movie
and audio-description (\unit[150]{s}; sigma=\unit[75.0]{s}).
% brain extraction
Brains were extracted from surrounding tissues using BET \citep{smith2002bet}.
% spatial smoothing
As in the previous studies, data from all three paradigms were spatially
smoothed (Gaussian kernel with full width at half maximum of \unit[4.0]{mm}).
% grand mean normalization
A grand-mean intensity normalization was applied to each run of the functional
localizer and each segment of the naturalistic stimuli.

Data of every run were independently normalized ($z$-scored) to a mean of zero

%
The last 75 \acp{tr} of the audio-description were missing in subject-04 due to
an image reconstruction problem \citep[s.][]{hanke2014audiomovie}.
%
The \ac{srm} allows the number of voxels to be different across subjects but the

\paragraph{Fitting of shared response model: intro}

\todo[inline]{mention that just 'ao \& av' as input were also tested?}

We used the probabilistic \ac{srm} algorithm that approximates the \ac{srm}
based on the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm proposed by
\citep{chen2015reduced}, optimized by \citet{anderson2016enabling}, and
implemented in BrainIAK v.11 \citep[Brain Imaging Analysis
Kit;][]{kumar2020brainiak, kumar2020brainiaktutorial} in order to compute the
\ac{cfs} and the transformation matrices for the training subjects.


\paragraph{cross-validation stuff}
%
In order to avoid data leakage, we followed a leave-one-subject-out
cross-validation procedure:
%
for every subject $n$, we used the $N-1$ training subjects' \ac{bold} \ac{fmri}
responses to the functional localizer, movie, and audio-description to let the
algorithm calculate the \ac{cfs} and $N-1$ transformation matrices.


\paragraph{number of dimensions}

% iterations:
% The number of iterations for the algorithm to minimize the error was set to 30

% features
We chose a value of $k=10$ for the number of shared responses (i.e. the number
of the CFS's dimensions) to be computed considering the temporal and spatial
resolution of our data (\ac{tr} = \unit[2]{s}; \unit[2.5 $\times$ 2.5 $\times$
2.5]{mm}), the average number of voxels per bilateral \acp{roi}, and findings
from \citet{haxby2011common}.
%
\citet{haxby2011common} first used hyperalignment to create a \ac{cfs} of 1,000
dimensions based of functional data (\ac{tr} = \unit[3]{s}) of voxels (of size
\unit[3 $\times$ 3 $\times$ 3]{mm}) located in the ventral temporal cortex.
%
Then, \citet{haxby2011common} reduced the dimensionality of the \ac{cfs} by
applying a \ac{pca} in order to determine the subspace that is sufficient to
capture the full range of response-pattern distinctions.
%
Results revealed that approximately 35 principal components (i.e. dimensions)
were sufficient to represent the information content of a one-hour movie from
which the \ac{cfs} was derived.
%
Results also showed that the cortical topographies of category-selective brain
regions was preserved in the 35-dimensional \ac{cfs} \citep{haxby2011common}.
%
In the current study, we also explored \acp{cfs} of $k=5, 20, 30, 40, 50$ but
results barely varied from a 10-dimensional \ac{cfs}.

% ``The effect of number of PCs on BSC was similar for models that were based
% only on Princeton (n = 10) or Dartmouth (n = 11) data, suggesting that this
% estimate of dimensionality is robust across differences in scanning hardware
% and scanning parameters'' \citep{haxby2011common}.
%
% ``These dimensionality estimates are a function of the spatial and temporal
% resolution of fMRI and the number and variety of response vectors used to
% derive the common space'' \citep{guntupalli2016model}.
%
% ``The true dimensionality of representation in human cortex surely involves
% vastly more distinct tuning functions. Estimates of the dimensionality of
% cortical representation, therefore, will almost certainly be much higher as
% data with higher spatial and temporal resolution for larger and more varied
% samples of response vectors are used to build new common models''
% \citep{guntupalli2016model}.


\paragraph{the math shit}
% math shit from citep{vodrahalli2018mapping}

% ``SRM learns $N$ maps $W_{i}$ with orthogonal columns such that
% $||X_{i}-W_{i}S||_{F}$ is minimized over $\left\{ W_{i}\right\} _{i=1}^{N},S$,
% where $X_{i}\in\mathbb{R}^{v\times{T}}$ is the $i^{th}$ subject's fMRI
% response ($v$ voxels by $T$ repetition times) and
% $S\in\mathbb{R}^{k\times{T}}$ is a feature time-series in a $k$-dimensional
% shared space'' \citep{vodrahalli2018mapping}.

% explain shit
During model fitting, the algorithm uses each $n^{th}$ training subject's
response time series represented as matrix $X_{n}$ ({$v$} voxel by $t$ time
points) to calculate the \ac{cfs} $C$ ($k$ shared responses by $t$ time points)
and subject-specific, orthogonal transformation matrices $T_{n}$ ($v$ voxel by
$k$ shared responses).
% what do the matrices represent?
Each transformation matrix (or \textit{weight matrix}) reflects the loadings of
voxels (i.e. a subject-specific functional topography) onto the shared
responses.
% what are they good for% what are they good for??
Each transformation matrix allows to project the responses of voxels within a
subjects' bilateral \acp{roi} from anatomical voxel space into the
$k$-dimensional \ac{cfs}, and thus functionally aligns a subject's data.
% iteratively fitted
The transformation matrices are randomly initialized and fit over iterations to
minimize the error in explaining participant data.
%
At the same time, the time course of the shared responses in the \ac{cfs} is
learned (s.

%
In order to obtain the transformation matrix for the test subject, we then
aligned the test subject's data to the \ac{cfs} that was trained on the training
subjects' data:
%
the algorithm learns a mapping $T_{n}$ of the test subject's anatomical voxel
space into the \ac{cfs} that is kept fixed.
%
In order evaluate the relationship between the length of the naturalistic
stimulus used to align the test subject to the \ac{cfs} and estimation
performance, we based the computation of the transformation matrix on different
quantity of data:
%
For each naturalistic stimulus, we used one up to eight (i.e. all; each lasting
$\sim$\unit[15]{m}) segments to let the algorithm learn the orthogonal mapping
to the corresponding \acs{tr} of the \ac{cfs}:
%
each matrix has a size of $v$ voxels by $k$ shared responses but is based on a
different quantity of data used to calculate the mapping (i.e.  subject-specific
functional topographies).
%
As a result, we obtained eight different transformation matrices per subject and
per naturalistic stimulus.

\todo[inline]{I also tested averaging data in \ac{cfs}: similar results}

\todo[inline]{what I did not do in case of anatomical alignment: averaging data

%
We then estimated a test subject's results of the functional localizer contrast
(the empirical $Z$-map of the \ac{roi}) by projecting all training subjects'
empirical $Z$-maps from their voxel space trough the template into the test
subject's voxel space (i.e. through the \ac{cfs} in case of functional
alignment; through the MNI space in case of anatomical alignment).


\paragraph{masking; estimation via functional \& anatomical alignment}
%
First, empirical $Z$-maps were masked with the same procedure as the time series
data [by restricting the voxels to voxels within the union of the individual
\acp{ppa} \citep[s.][]{haeusler2022processing} that was warped from group space
into each subjects' space, and the subject-specific \ac{fov} of the
audio-description]
% functional alignment; into CFS (calling srm.transform(masked\_zmaps))
In the case of estimation via functional alignment, we used the transformation
matrices that were derived during training of the \ac{srm} in order to project
the masked empirical $Z$-maps from each training subjects' voxel space into the
\ac{cfs}.
% into subject
We then used the transpose of the transformation matrix that we acquired during
the alignment of the test subject, in order to project the data from the
\ac{cfs} into the test subject's anatomical voxel space.
% take the mean
The arithmetic mean of $N-1$ the projected empirical $Z$-maps served as the
predicted $Z$-map estimating the test subject's empirical $Z$-map.
% anatomical alignment; into MNI
In case of estimation via anatomical alignment, we used previously computed
transformation matrices
\citep[][\href{https://github.com/psychoinformatics-de/studyforrest-data-templatetransforms
}{\url{github.com/psychoinformatics-de/studyforrest-data-templatetransforms}}]{hanke2014audiomovie}
in order to project the data via a non-linear transformation from each training
subject into the MNI space.
% from MNI into subject
We then used the transpose of the transformation matrix [did I? or was it
another matrix?] in order to project the data from MNI space into the test
subject's voxel space.
%
As in the case of functional alignment, the arithmetic mean of the projected
$Z$-maps served as a test subject's predicted $Z$-map.

\todo[inline]{was it transpose of the matrix to warp from MNI into subject, or
a separate one?}


\subsection{Quantifying the performance (Pearson + Cronbach's)}

\todo[inline]{add text about "auditory PPA"}
%
In order to quantify the performance of our two different estimation procedures,
we calculated the Pearson's correlation coefficients as a measure of similarity
between the empirical $Z$-maps gained from the localizer experiment and the
predicted $Z$-maps.
%
Further, we compare the prediction performance to the internal consistency (i.e.
reliability) of the visual localizer by calculating Cronbach's Alpha across the
four runs of the localizer.

\todo[inline]{do not localize higher-visual areas but lower and "intermediate"}

\todo[inline]{they seem to not use a threshold because they do not use contrasts
but cycles/phase shifting}

Abstract: `` Identifying topographically organized regions in individual
subjects is a powerful approach to group-level statistical analysis, but this is
not always feasible.
%
We generated probabilistic maps of visual topographic areas in 2 standardized
spaces suitable for use with adult human brains.
%
We identified 25 topographic maps in a large population of individual subjects
(N = 53) and transformed them into either a surface- or volume-based
standardized space.
%
We provide a quantitative characterization of the inter-subject variability
within and across visual regions, including the likelihood that a given point
would be classified as a part of any region (full probability map) and the most
probable region for any given point (maximum probability map).
%
We validate each atlas for use with independent subjects.
%
The probabilistic atlases quantify the variability of topographic
representations in human cortex and provide a useful reference for comparing
data across studies that can be transformed into these standard spaces''.


Identifying all of the currently known topographic regions of the
human visual system requires multiple scanning sessions. Given the expense and
availability of fMRI, this is not always practical.

One way to address these limitations is to create an atlas in a standard space
that links individual points in that space with functionally defined regions.
%
Given the anatomical and functional variability across subjects, this atlas
should be "probabilistic": it defines the likelihood of a given coordinate being
associated with a given functional region.
%
Such an atlas could be used to infer the topographic location in the visual
system for the results obtained from any independent dataset once transformed
into the same standard space as the atlas.

We used the conventional approach of drawing are borders by hand.
%
At least 2 experimenters experienced in retinotopic mapping drew borders
independently using the same set of published criteria (detailed below).

Full and maximum probability maps (of nodes and voxels respectively)
%
After normalization to standard space, corresponding ROIs from every subject
were superimposed.
%
For each ROI, a full probability map (FPM) was generated by dividing, at each
particular node, the number of times that location belonged to that ROI by the
number of subjects included for that ROI.
%
The probability values represent the likelihood that any node in the SBA would
be classified as part of a given visual area.

%
A maximum probability map (MPM) was calculated for each node by comparing
the probabilities of all areas at that node and assigning the node to the area
with the highest probability.
%

First, the probabilistic atlas provides an unbiased approach to comparing the
relative location of different functional activations with visual topography in
meta-analyses.
%
Second, a probabilistic atlas can be used under conditions in which collecting
the data to define maps in individual subjects is impractical or not feasible.
%
For example, time-limitations and subject-fatigue both potentially limit the
time researchers may be able to spend with patients suffering from
neurological or neuropsychological disorders, or with implanted subdural or deep
electrodes (e.g., ECoG).
%
Although some of these electrodes are likely over visual topographic areas, it
is impossible to assign these electrodes to a specific visual area without a
functional benchmark.


\subsubsection{templates from \citet{rosenke2021probabilistic}}

\todo[inline]{many regions, including PPA}

\todo[inline]{compute thresholded clusters and then manually adjust thresholds}

Abstract: ``Human visual cortex contains many retinotopic and category-specific
regions.
%
As studying these regions requires accurate localization of their cortical
location, researchers perform functional localizer scans to identify these
regions in each individual.
%
However, it is not always possible to conduct these localizer scans.
%
We developed and validated a functional region of interest (ROI) atlas of early
visual and category-selective regions in human ventral and lateral
occipito-temporal cortex.
%
Results show that for the majority of functionally defined ROIs, cortex-based
alignment results in lower between-subject variability compared to nonlinear
volumetric alignment.
%
We demonstrate that
%
1) the atlas accurately predicts the location of an independent dataset of
ventral temporal cortex ROIs and other atlases of place selectivity, motion
selectivity, and retinotopy.
%
2) the majority of voxel within our atlas is responding mostly to the labeled
category in a left-out subject cross-validation, demonstrating the utility of
this atlas.
%
The functional atlas is publicly available and can help identify the location of
these regions in healthy subjects as well as populations (e.g., blind people,
infants) in which functional localizers cannot be run''.

``The ROI approach is advantageous for four reasons:
%
1) it allows hypothesis driven comparisons of signals within independently
defined ROIs across many different conditions,
%
2) it increases statistical sensitivity in multisubject analyses [Nieto–
Castañón and Fedorenko 2012],
%
3) it reduces the number of multiple comparisons present in whole-brain analyses
[Saxe et al.  2006], and
%
4) it identifies ROIs in each participant's native brain space''.

There are also several limitations to the independent localizer approach.
%
First, it is not always possible to obtain an independent localizer scan.
%
This is especially the case in patient populations, for example in the
congenitally blind [Mahon et al. 2009; Bedny et al. 2011; Striem-Amit, Cohen, et
al. 2012a; van den Hurk et al. 2017] or individuals with visual
agnosia/prosopagnosia [Schiltz and Rossion 2006; Steeves et al. 2006; Sorger et
al.  2007; Barton 2008; Gilaie-Dotan et al. 2009; Susilo et al. 2015].
%
Second, performing a localizer scan before each experiment is costly in terms of
scanning time, as well as mental effort and attention resources of the
participant.
%
The latter can result in fatigue during the main experiment of interest, leading
to lower quality data.
%
Third, as localizer scans are typically conducted in a subject-specific manner
and researchers vary in the manner they define the ROIs (e.g., whether smoothing
was employed, if they use anatomical constraints, what thresholding methods were
employed), it is hard to assess variability between participants and across
studies.

To overcome these limitations, cortical atlases have been developed, which
allow localization of visual areas in new subjects by leveraging ROI data from
an independent set of typical participants [Frost and Goebel 2012; ventral
temporal cortex (VTC) category selectivity: Julian et al. 2012; Engell and
McCarthy 2013; Zhen et al.  2017; Weiner et al. 2018; visual field maps: Benson
et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2015; motion-selective hMT: Huang et al. 2019;
multimodal parcellation: Glasser et al. 2016; cytoarchitectonic parcellation of
ventral visual cortex: Rosenke et al. 2018].
%
In addition to providing independent means to identify ROIs, this approach
enables quantification of between-subject variability.
%
Further, the process of atlas creation also enables measuring the prevalence and
robustness of each ROI across participants.
%
Presently, atlases for the human visual system include atlases of visual field
maps [Benson et al. 2012, 2014; Wang et al.  2015; Benson and Winawer 2018] and
atlases of cytoarchitectonically defined areas [Amunts et al. 2000; Rottschy et
al. 2007; Caspers et al. 2013; Kujovic et al. 2013; Lorenz et al. 2015; Rosenke
et al. 2018].
%
Presently, there is no atlas of the full extent of visual category-selective
regions in occipito-temporal cortex or atlases that include both visual regions
that are defined retinotopically as well as from stimulus selectivity.

All ROIs where manually defined in individual subjects on their cortical
surface reconstruction in BrainVoyager.
%
The final atlas includes all regions that could be defined in more than 50\% of
the subjects (N >= 10; see Table 1 for number of subjects per atlas ROI).''

Each category (e.g., faces) was contrasted against the mean of all other
categories to identify vertices that displayed a preference for the given
category.
%
We followed a two-step approach to define ROIs:
%
First, for all categories we selected a statistical threshold of t=3 for a
whole-brain map.
%
Based on the thresholded activation map, we identified ROIs in anatomically
plausible locations.
%
In the case of an activation cluster transitioning into an adjacent one of the
same visual category, we divided those clusters into separate ROIs by following
the spatial gradient of t-values and separating the two areas at the lowest
t-value.

One interesting feature of those fROIs is the possibility to serve as a prior
to estimate the localization of corresponding ROIs in a new subject's brain,
eliminating the need for a dedicated localizer run in the new subject.
%
To allow for a probabilistic estimate to find this region in a new subject, we
performed an exhaustive LOOCV analysis after the volumetric (NVA) as well as
surface (CBA) alignment to establish how well our atlas can predict fROIs in new
subjects.
%
For each fold of the LOOCV, we generated a group probabilistic fROI (G) and a
left-out subject's individual fROI (I).
%
We estimated the predictability of the group probabilistic fROI by calculating
the Dice coefficient (DSC), a measure of similarity of two samples.

A Dice coefficient of zero indicates no predictability and a Dice coefficient of
1 indicates perfect predictability.
%
As we did in previous work [Rosenke et al. 2018], we applied different threshold
levels to the group probabilistic fROI (G) to predict the location of the
left-out subject (Fig. 2).
%
That means we created a liberal group probabilistic fROI including each vertex
that was present in at least 1 subject.
%
Then, we sequentially increased the threshold up to the most conservative
threshold where all subjects had to share a voxel/vertex for it to be included
in the group map.
%
We compared Dice coefficients across the two alignment methods using a repeated
measures analysis of variance with individual regions as different entries,
alignment method (CBA vs. NVA) as within-subject factor, and hemisphere as
between-subject factor.
%
We ran this comparison on two different thresholds:
%
once on unthresholded group maps, and once on a threshold that produced - across
regions and methods - the highest predictability.
%
To determine this threshold, we averaged Dice coefficient values across
alignment methods, hemispheres, and ROIs, resulting in one Dice coefficient per
threshold level [as done in Rosenke et al. 2018].
%
Comparison across thresholds revealed that a threshold of 0.2 produced the
highest predictability.
%
Additionally, we ran paired permutation tests within each region on Dice
coefficient results at threshold 0.2 to establish whether the specific region
showed a significant Dice coefficient for either alignment (NVA or CBA).
%
Finally, we calculated the mean ROI surface area for each hemisphere
and ROI (Fig. 3) and used a paired t-statistic to assess whether there was a
systematic hemispheric difference in size across ROIs.

Generating a visfAtlas by Assigning Each Voxel and Vertex to a Unique fROI.
%
The processes provide a non-overlapping tiling of the
functionally defined regions in occipito-temporal cortex in surface as well as
volume space.
%

Cortex-Based Alignment.
%
The probability maps determine the probability that each vertex belongs to a
given fROI.
%
However, it is possible that a point on the brain may belong to more than one
probabilistic fROI.
%
This overlap is more likely to occur along boundaries of neighboring functional
regions.
%
In order to assign a unique functional label to each vertex in the atlas, we
generated a maximum probability map (MPM) of each area, once in volume space
(NVA) and once in surface space (CBA).
%
Using the probabilistic fROIs, we determined which vertices were shared by more
than one probabilistic fROI and assigned these vertices to a single fROI based
on the area that showed the highest probability at that vertex [Eickhoff et al.
2005].
%
In cases where two areas held the same probability value for one vertex, we
averaged the probabilistic values of neighbors of that vertex for each of the
fROIs.
%
The degree of neighbors averaged was increased until the vertex had a higher
probability value in one of the areas.


There are several factors that can influence consistency across subjects.
%
First, ROI size has been shown to influence across-subject consistency measures
using the Dice coefficient [Rosenke et al. 2018].
%
Therefore, we determined if there is a correlation between the cross-validated
Dice coefficient and average fROI surface area.
%
Second, we established whether categories differ in reproducibility of cortical
responses within a subject.
%
We reasoned that across-subject variability cannot be expected to be lower than
within-subject variability over time (reproducibility).
%
Hence, it can be used as a proxy for noise ceiling.

Validation of the visfAtlas with an Independent Dataset of Category-Selectivity
in VTC and With an Increasing Number of Subjects.
%
Common consideration in building atlases are
%
1) the number of subjects that are used to build the atlas and
%
2) how well it can predict new datasets.
%
To address whether our sample size is sufficient to achieve generalizability to
new data, we tested how well the visfAtlas predicts fROIs of 12 new subjects.
%
These data were acquired using a similar localizer in a different scanning
facility, identified by independent experiments, and have been published
previously [Stigliani et al.  2015; Weiner et al. 2017].
%
We compared their fROI definitions of mFus-faces, pFus-faces, OTS-bodies,
pOTS-characters, and CoS-places to our visfAtlas definitions in the following
ways:
%
1) We visualized our visfAtlas MPMs in relation to their probability maps of
each of the fROIs (Fig. 6), and
%
2) we calculated how well our visfAtlas predicted each of their individual
subjects' fROIs using the Dice coefficient.
%
Lastly, to address how the number of subjects affects the accuracy of our
visfAtlas, we calculated the Dice coefficient for different iterations of the
visfAtlas in which we incrementally increased the number of subjects from 2 to
19.

To quantify which group alignment resulted in higher consistency and therewith
predictability, we used the Dice coefficient (DSC) and an LOOCV procedure to
determine the predictability of finding the same region in a new subject.
%
Moreover, we calculated the Dice coefficient using different thresholds for the
probabilistic group map, ranging from a liberal unthreshold (one subject at a
given voxel/vertex is enough to assign it to the group map) map to a
conservative threshold where all N-1 subjects had to share a voxel/vertex to be
assigned to the group map.
%
For retinotopically defined regions, DSCs varied between 0.35 and 0.59 for peak
probability after CBA, and between 0.30 and 0.42 after NVA.
%
Especially regions with a lower predictability overall tended to show higher
predictability after NVA for more conservative group thresholds (Fig. 2B,
mFus-faces, TOS-bodies).
%
For CBA, peak predictability (DSC) for each region ranged from 0.1 to 0.60,
while it ranged from 0.1 to 0.42 for NVA, with character-selective regions
showing the lowest consistency for both alignments, closely followed by mFus-
and IOG-faces''.

A Functional Atlas of Occipito-Temporal Cortex in Volume and Surface Space
%
By systematically varying the group map threshold for predicting a left-out
subject's fROI, we established that a group map threshold of 0.2 allows for
greatest predictability across regions.
%
Using the 0.2 threshold, we generated a functional atlas of occipito-temporal
cortex by generating an MPM (see Methods for details).

Generalizability of Functional Atlas: Functional responsivity in Left-Out Data.
%
A probabilistic atlas has the ability to locate an ROI with a degree of
certainty (as established using the Dice coefficient analysis) in a new subject
without the need to run a localizer itself.
%
In order to quantify the atlas' generalizability, the category responsivity of
the category-selective areas in new participants is a crucial metric.
%
Therefore, we performed a leave-subject-out responsivity analysis in volume
space to assess category responsivity.
%
For each fROI, we established the percentage of voxel that showed the strongest
response to each available category (Fig. 7).
%
For all category-selective regions, we confirmed that the category it is
selective for indeed yields the highest percentage of maximum voxel responsivity
across subjects.

Future studies may explore the possibility to generate more
sophisticated atlases, which contain not only a unique tiling of cortical
regions but also allow for multiple functional clusters to occupy overlapping
areas and indicate probabilities for multiple categories at each voxel.

%
We hope that this atlas may prove especially useful for
%
1) predicting an ROI when no localizer data is available, saving scanning time
and expenses,
%
2) comparisons across modalities and
%
3) patient populations, such as patients who have a brain lesion [Schiltz and
Rossion 2006; Steeves et al. 2006; Sorger et al. 2007; Barton 2008; Gilaie-Dotan
et al. 2009; de Heering and Rossion 2015] or are blind [Mahon et al. 2009; Bedny
et al. 2011; Striem-Amit, Dakwar, et al.  2012b; van den Hurk et al. 2017]''.

Abstract: The goal of the present study was to identify the most probable
location of place-selective voxels in medial ventral temporal cortex.
%
We used cortex-based alignment (CBA) to create a probabilistic
place-selective region of interest (ROI) from group of 12 participants.
%
Our results reveal that a probabilistic ROI (pROI) generated from one group of
12 participants accurately predicts the location and functional selectivity in
individual brains from a new group of 12 participants, despite between subject
variability in the exact location of place-selective voxels relative to the
folding of parahippocampal cortex.
%
The prediction accuracy of our pROI is significantly higher than
that achieved by volume-based Talairach alignment.
%
Comparing the location of the pROI of the PPA relative to published data from
over 500 participants (data from Human Connectome Project) shows a
striking convergence of the predicted location of the PPA and the cortical
location of voxels exhibiting the highest place selectivity across studies using
various methods and stimuli.
%
The most predictive anatomical location of voxels exhibiting the
highest place selectivity in medial ventral temporal cortex is the junction of
the collateral and anterior lingual sulci.
%
We make this pROI freely available, which provides a means to
accurately identify a functional region from anatomical MRI data when fMRI data
are not available.
%

PPA is located within a gross anatomical territory that contains several
macroanatomical structures including the collateral sulcus (CoS), the lingual
sulcus, (LS), and the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) [Aguirre et al., 1998; Avidan
et al., 2002; Epstein and Kanwisher, 1998; Epstein, 2008; Levy et al., 2004;
Nasr et al., 2011; Weiner and Grill-Spector, 2010; Weiner et al., 2010].
%
These macroanatomical structures span several centimeters, making it hard to
precisely predict the exact location of place selectivity from cortical folding
patterns alone [s. Epstein (2014) for a review].
%

The identification of the PPA is complicated by (at least) four methodological
considerations:
%
1) the PPA definition may depend on the type of experiment, task, and stimuli
used.
%
2) The boundaries of the PPA may depend on the statistical threshold used.
%
3) The spatial extent and localization of the PPA may vary if defined within the
native brain space of an individual or based on a group analysis.
%
4) The size of the PPA may depend on data acquisition choices (e.g. large vs.
small voxels) and data analysis choices (e.g. liberal smoothing vs. no spatial
smoothing).
%
We identify and to predict the most probable location of place-selective voxels
within medial VTC of an individual brain that is impervious to these
methodological decisions.

We implemented a three-fold approach:
%
1) we generated a probabilistic group ROI of place-selective voxels using
cortex-based alignment [Fischl et al., 1999].
%
2) We quantified how well this probabilistic ROI predicts the location of
the PPA, as well as place-selective fMRI responses, from an independent
experiment and a separate set of participants.
%
3) We tested if this probabilistic ROI also captures the locus of highest
place selectivity in (a) our data and (b) a separate set of data collected from
over 500 participants by other researchers using different stimuli, tasks, and
methods [shared from Nasr et al., 2014 and the Human Connectome Project, Barch
et al., 2013].

Results from the analyses demonstrate that
%
a) the anatomical location of place-selective voxels relative to cortical
folding is consistent across participants,
%
b) the probabilistic ROI identifies the location of the PPA in individual
brains from multiple independent datasets,
%
c) the probabilistic ROI encapsulates voxels in medial VTC exhibiting the
highest place selectivity in our data as well as shared data from other labs.
%

Place-selective voxels were defined within each subject's native brain anatomy
using a common threshold (t > 3, voxel-level) for both Studies 1 and 2.
%
Study 1 compared BOLD responses to images of places relative to images of faces,
bodies, characters (numbers and pseudowords), and objects (cars and guitars).

Generating a group probabilistic region of interest (pROI) of place selectivity.
%
We generated separate probabilistic ROIs from the 12 participants in Study 1 and
the 12 participants in Study 2.
%
Probabilistic ROIs were generated using cortex-based alignment (CBA) in
FreeSurfer (Fischl et al., 1999; http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/).
%
The cortical surface of each of our 12 participants was aligned to the
FreeSurfer average surface (from 39 healthy adults not used in our study) using
a high-dimensional nonlinear registration algorithm.
%
We then transformed functional ROIs (fROIs) from each subject to the FreeSurfer
(FS) average brain.
%
Probabilistic maps were then generated by summing the 12 fROIs at each point
along the cortical surface of the FS average brain and dividing by the number of
participants.
%
Each vertex within the map reflects the proportion of participants exhibiting
place selectivity at that location on the cortical surface.

Probabilistic ROIs were generated using three different thresholds to test if
and how different threshold values influence the predictability of place
selectivity in a new group of participants.
%
(1) unthresholded,
%
(2) thresholded by 33\% overlapping participants, or
%
(3) thresholded by 66\% overlapping participants.
%
Based on related work [Weiner et al., 2017], a threshold of 0.33 is sufficient
for predicting functional ROIs in VTC.
%
The pROI from Study 1 was previously published [Weiner et al., 2017].

Assessing the correspondence between the probabilistic ROI and
individually-defined ROIs in independent participants.
%
Using data from Study 1, we generated three probabilistic ROIs.
%
Using data from Study 2, we used CBA to align each subject's cortical surface to
the FS average brain and then used the same transformation to project fROIs from
each individual subject to the FS average brain.
%
Because these individual fROIs were in the same common space as the
probabilistic ROI from Study 1, we could compare their spatial locations on the
cortical surface.
%
We calculated the Dice coefficient to determine how well our probabilistic ROIs
from Study 1 predicted each individually-defined ROI from Study 2 on the FS
average brain.

%
The Dice coefficient is calculated with the following formula:
%
P is the surface area of the probabilistic ROI.
%
A is the surface area of the actual ROI in an individual subject.
%
We repeated this calculation for the probabilistic ROI generated from Study 2
and the individual subject fROIs from Study 1.

%
We repeated the calculation an additional time with an exhaustive leave-one-out
cross validation procedure using data from all 24 participants and then compared
our calculations to results using Talairach alignment.

%
Perfect alignment between the probabilistic prediction and the actual ROI in
individual subjects would result in a Dice coefficient of 1 and complete
misclassification would result in a Dice coefficient of 0.

%
We calculated a ceiling (the empirically best dice coefficient given the noise
in the data) performance as the Dice coefficient between the probabilistic ROI
in Study 1 and each individual subject from Study 1 that contributed to
generating the probabilistic ROI from the same experiment.
%
We repeated this estimate of the ceiling performance for Study 2 as well.
%
The ceiling performance plotted in Fig. 2 (horizontal gray bar) is the average
of the two estimates''.

Comparing our predictions using CBA to volume-based, Talairach alignment.
%
Prior work shows that functional regions in high-level visual cortex are better
aligned to one another after CBA compared to stereotaxic alignment [Frost and
Goebel, 2012].
%
We repeated our leave-one-out cross-validation procedure across all 24
participants with an affine volume-based registration to the Talairach brain and
compared this performance to the same procedure implemented with CBA in
FreeSurfer (Fig. 2D).

Testing the functional profile of probabilistic predictions.
%
We also examined if the voxels in this probabilistic ROI displayed significantly
higher BOLD responses to places compared to other stimuli.
%
We used CBA to project the probabilistic ROI generated from Study 1 on the FS
average brain to the native brain space of each subject from Study 2.
%
We extracted response amplitudes from this ROI to each of the stimuli shown in
Study 2 in each individual subject.
%
Then, we tested whether this ROI exhibited stronger responses to places compared
to other stimuli (Fig. 3).

Examining the topological relationship between the probabilistic ROI and peak
place selectivity in medial VTC in over 500 participants.
%
We tested whether or not our pROI captured voxels that exhibit the highest (the
'peak') place-selectivity in medial VTC in new participants.
%
We define 'peak' as those voxels with the highest selectivity as indicated
by the t-statistic.
%
We examined if the probabilistic pROI contains
%
a) peak place-selective voxels within medial VTC in individual participants
from our data (24 participants, Fig. 4),
%
b) the group average peak selectivity across 24 participants from our data
(Figs. 4 and 5),
%
c) the cortical location of peak place selectivity from 247 participants from
the Human Connectome Project (HCP) 500 Participants Release [Barch et al., 2013;
Fig. 5],
%
d) the cortical location of peak place selectivity from a separate set of 247
participants from the HCP 500 Participants Release [Barch et al., 2013; Fig. 5],
and
%
e) the cortical location of peak place selectivity from a separate set of 26
participants from a recent study [Nasr et al., 2014, Fig. 5]''.

There is a fundamental difference between the probability map of place-selective
ROIs (Fig. 2) and the selectivity maps (Figs.  4 and 5).
%
The map of pROIs across subjects is generated after assigning either a 1 (if the
ROI is present) or a 0 (if the ROI is not present) at vertices of the FS average
surface.
%
In the pROI case, there is a threshold and the group map does not reflect
selectivity and instead represents the percentage of overlap across subjects at
each vertex.

%
The selectivity map reflects a continuous metric in which a vertex is assigned a
selectivity value (a t-statistic) first for each subject and then averaged
across subjects.
%
The selectivity map is not thresholded and the group map directly indicates
selectivity (each vertex reflects the average t-value across subjects).
%

Results

Place-selective voxels in medial VTC are located in the banks of the CoS with
inter-subject variability.
%
Our data illustrate that macroanatomical features create a reliable set of
landmarks that confine place selectivity in medial ventral temporal cortex
(VTC), which replicates and extends previous findings [Aguirre et al., 1998;
Epstein and Kanwisher, 1998; Nasr et al., 2011, 2014; Weiner et al., 2010;
Weiner and Grill-Spector, 2010].
%
Our data show that place-selective voxels are consistently located within the
banks of the collateral sulcus (CoS) in individual participants (Fig. 1).
%
Posteriorly, place-selective voxels seldom extend past the posterior tip of the
anterior lingual sulcus (ALS) and posterior lingual sulcus (PLS).
%
Anteriorly, place-selective voxels often macroanatomically align with the
anterior tip of the mid-fusiform sulcus (MFS).
%
This structural-functional coupling is not always perfect and there is
inter-subject variability as to how much the place-selective voxels extend
within the PHG, as well as the LG and medial aspects of the fusiform gyrus (FG).
%
Despite this inter-subject variability, place-selective voxels are always
located within the CoS across participants.
%
The consistency between the identification of place-selective voxels and
cortical folding suggests that it may be possible to use cortex-based alignment
to generate a group probabilistic ROI that would predict the most probable
location of place selectivity within VTC in independent participants.

Cortex-based alignment generates a group-based probabilistic ROI that maintains
the structural-functional relationship between place selectivity and cortical
folding.
%
Using cortex-based alignment (CBA) tools in FreeSurfer (FS), we generated a
probabilistic ROI (pROI) of place selectivity separately for each study.
%
To determine the utility of this pROI:
%
1) we examined if the group pROI maintains the structural-functional coupling
observed in individual participants,
%
2) we tested if the group pROI is stable across studies that used different
methods, and
%
3) we used a cross-validation approach to quantify how well the pROI predicts
the location of the actual ROI in a new group of participants.

%
Examining the location of the pROI generated from Study 1 on the FS average
brain reveals that the macroanatomical location of the pROI (Fig. 2A) falls
within the same series of anatomical landmarks we identified in individual
participants.
%
Furthermore, projecting the pROI from Study 2 on the FS average
brain revealed a close correspondence between the pROIs across the two studies
(Fig. 2B).

%
To quantify how well pROIs predict functionally-defined ROIs in an independent
group of participants, we used the Dice coefficient metric to calculate the
amount of spatial correspondence between the two regions in individual brains.
%
We did this analysis using group pROIs from Study 1 and individual ROIs from
Study 2 and vice versa, measuring cross-validation performance at three
threshold levels (no threshold, 33\%, and 66\%).
%
The ceiling Dice coefficient in our data is 0.73 +/- 0.03 in the left hemisphere
and 0.72 +/- 0.03 in the right hemisphere.

%
Results of the cross-validation analysis reveal that our pROI predicts
individual ROIs with high accuracy across hemispheres.
%
At a threshold of 33\%, the Dice coefficient is 0.70 +/- 0.03 in the right
hemisphere and 0.65 +/- 0.03 in the left.
%
The predictability of the pROI approached (but was significantly lower than) the
ceiling performance in both hemispheres (all ts > 3.3, all ps < 0.003).
%
A more lenient pROI (an unthresholded ROI) as well as a more stringent ROI (a
thresholded ROI at 66\%) also revealed Dice coefficients larger than 0.5, with
numerical values varying with threshold (Fig. 2C).
%
The unthresholded ROI had the lowest predictability (right: 0.56 +/- 0.03; left:
0.52 +/- 0.03) and the 66\% thresholded ROI had an intermediate predictability
(right: 0.61 +/- 0.03; left: 0.60 +/- 0.03); all were significantly lower than
the ceiling performance (all ts > 4.5, all ps < 10-4).


We also performed an exhaustive leave-one out cross validation (LOOCV) procedure
using data from all 24 participants across both studies.
%
In each iteration, the pROI was first generated from 23 participants and then
tested how well it predicted the left out, 24th participant.
%
Since the 33\% thresholded pROI performed the best in the prior analyses, we
used this threshold for the present (and subsequent) analyses.
%
Results again revealed high predictability in the right (mean Dice 0.72 +/-
0.03) and left hemisphere (0.70 +/- 0.03, which was not different than the
ceiling performance (all ts < .7, all ps > .5; Fig. 2D).
%
Thus, cross-validated performance from 23 participants is not significantly
different than the ceiling performance, which provides statistical evidence
supporting that the structural-functional predictability from our participants
likely reflects a predictability that is reflective of the general population
(see Fig.5).
%
Together, analyses reveal that the group pROI maintains the
structural-functional coupling observed in individual participants and it is
possible to predict the location of place-selective voxels in medial VTC from
cortical folding alone.

Cortex-based alignment out-performs volume-based alignment by nearly a factor of
two.
%
Our previous work quantifying the relationship between cortical folding and
face-selective regions showed that surface-based predictions out-performed
predictions based on stereotaxic coordinates [Weiner et al., 2014].
%
Nevertheless, predicting the location of place selectivity from stereotaxic
coordinates may not be as impeded as face-selective regions.
%
Hence, we repeated the exhaustive LOOCV procedure across 24 participants using
Talairach-based alignment.
%
We then compared the Dice coefficients between this approach and those resulting
from CBA (using the pROI with the 33\% threshold).
%
The mean Dice coefficients for the Talairach-based approach were 0.48 +/- 0.04
and 0.37 +/- 0.03 in the right and left hemispheres (Fig. 2D).
%
These Dice coefficients were lower than CBA, as CBA out-performed Talairach
alignment by nearly a factor of two in the right hemisphere (1.85 ± 0.26) and by
a factor of more than two in the left hemisphere (2.23 ± 0.24).
%
The implementation of CBA significantly improved the alignment and
predictability of place selectivity within medial VTC across participants
compared to Talairach alignment.

Probabilistic ROI identifies voxels exhibiting highest BOLD responses to places
in individual participants.
%
To further test the effectiveness of our predictions, we extracted the response
amplitudes from the pROI.
%
Wee used CBA to project the pROI from Study 1 to each individual brain of the
participants in Study 2.
%
We then extracted the response amplitudes from the pROI in each individual
subject.
%
We used the 33\% thresholded pROI, which produced the highest Dice coefficient
in the previous analyses.
%
The predicted ROI exhibited significantly higher mean response amplitudes to
scenes compared to cars, abstract objects, faces, and textures (Fig. 3).

Probabilistic ROI identifies the location of 'peak' place selectivity in over
500 participants.
%
A related experimental question is whether this pROI captures the 'peak' voxels
exhibiting the highest place selectivity in medial VTC.
%
To address this question, we first generated a group map of place selectivity
across our 24 participants to visualize the locus of peak place selectivity
across subjects and experiments used to generate the pROI.
%
We used CBA to generate an average map of selectivity in which vertices are
assigned continuous values of place selectivity rather than a binary distinction
as in the probability maps from the prior analyses.
%
We then visualized the group place selectivity map relative to the group pROI
from all 24 participants.
%
Fig. 4 shows an unthresholded group map of place selectivity (calculated from
data across 24 participants from Studies 1 and 2) on the FS average brain
relative to the outline of our pROI.
%
Consistent with prior research [Baldassano et al., 2013; Epstein, 2008; Nasr et
al., 2011; Silson et al., 2016] the group map illustrates place selectivity
within the CoS, LG, PHG, the parietal occipital sulcus (POS), and retrosplenial
cortex (RSC).
%
Weakly (t-values greater than 0 and less than 2) place-selective voxels do
extend into the medial fusiform gyrus and more posteriorly along the CoS.
%
The locus ("hotspot") of peak place selectivity is near the medial lip of the
CoS in the right hemisphere and close to the center of our pROI near the fundus
of the CoS in the left hemisphere (Fig. 4A).
%
The locus of peak place selectivity is within the group pROI (Fig. 4A-black
contour).
%
Examining the location of our pROI relative to the peak cluster of place
selectivity in individual participants shows that there are individual
differences in the location of voxels with highest place selectivity (Fig.
4B-C):
%
voxels with the highest place selectivity are not always located within the same
exact location in the pROI for each participant and small clusters of high place
selectivity can also extend outside of the pROI.
%
Despite these individual differences, all participants have voxels with the
highest place selectivity within the pROI (Fig. 4B–C).
%
Crucially, our pROI not only identifies voxels exhibiting the highest
selectivity in our own data, but also identifies voxels exhibiting the highest
place selectivity in independent datasets from over 500 participants.
%
Comparisons reveal two main results.
%
1) the location of peak place selectivity occurs within the CoS in two separate
splits (each consisting of data from 247 participants) from the HCP 500 subject
release [Barch et al., 2013], as well as data from 26 participants from [Nasr et
al., 2014] (cf. Fig. 5).
%
2) despite variability in the exact location of peak selectivity across
datasets, the locus of peak place selectivity across these experiments differing
in stimuli, tasks, methods, and participants is located within our pROI.
%
Altogether, results suggest that
%
a) our pROI of place selectivity is a robust predictor of the location of high
place selectivity within medial VTC and
%
b) these predictions are generalizable across data collected with different
scanners, participants, images used for localization, data acquisition, and
analysis methods.

Discussion

We examined the relationship between cortical folding patterns and the most
probable location of place selectivity in medial ventral temporal cortex (VTC).
%
Results show that cortical folding patterns and probabilistic predictions
reliably identify place-selective voxels in medial VTC across individuals and
experiments.


Predicting functional regions from cortical folding across the visual hierarchy.
%
Our findings contribute to a growing body of work supporting a tight
relationship between cortical folding and functional regions across the visual
hierarchy.
%
V1 is reliably located within the calcarine sulcus [Henschen, 1893; Inouye,
1909].
%
Intermediate visual areas are also located in consistent locations relative to
cortical folding:
%
V3A abuts and extends into the transverse occipital sulcus [Nasr et al., 2011;
Tootell et al., 1997]
%
the anterior boundary of human V4 is located within the posterior transverse
collateral sulcus [Witthoft et al., 2014], and
%
hMT+ is found at the intersection of the lateral occipital sulcus and the
ascending branch of the posterior inferotemporal sulcus [Dumoulin et al., 2000].

%
Several high-level category-selective regions have also been reported to be
reliably located relative to cortical folding patterns.
%
The fusiform face area is composed of at least two distinct regions (mFus-faces
and pFus-faces), which are well predicted by the mid-fusiform sulcus [Weiner et
al., 2014, 2017; Weiner and Grill-Spector, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013; Weiner and
Zilles, 2016; Grill-Spector and Weiner, 2014]
%
The fusiform body area/OTS-limbs [Weiner and Grill-Spector, 2010, 2013] and the
visual word form area are reliably found in the occipitotemporal sulcus
[Ben-Shachar et al., 2007; Glezer and Riesenhuber, 2013; Stigliani et al., 2015;
Wandell et al., 2012; Yeatman et al., 2013].
%
The extrastriate body area is composed of at least three anatomically
distinct regions that are localized to the lateral occipital sulcus (LOS-limbs),
inferotemporal gyrus (ITG-limbs), and middle temporal gyrus (MTG-limbsi)[Weiner
and Grill-Spector, 2011, 2013].

%
We extend these findings to now include a precise set of anatomical landmarks
identifying place-selective voxels within medial VTC.
%
Prior studies have reported place selectivity within the CoS [Epstein and
Kanwisher, 1998; Levy et al., 2001; Levy et al., 2004; Nasr et al., 2011; Weiner
and Grill-Spector, 2010; Weiner et al., 2010].
%
Nevertheless, the CoS is very long extending nearly across the entire length of
the ventral portions of the occipital and temporal lobes.

%
Current findings provide a series of anatomical landmarks that constrain the
location of place-selective voxels to a specific location along the CoS.
%
In particular, the CoS/ALS junction is most predictive of place selectivity as
illustrated by the convergence of place selectivity across studies in this
location (Fig. 5).
%
The tight coupling between cortical folding and place selectivity identified in
the present study suggests that our pROI can predict place selectivity in the
human brain with high likelihood using cortex-based alignment methods.
%
This finding is consistent with other recent studies that showed that CBA
improves the registration of functional data across participants [Benson et al.,
2012, 2014; Frost and Goebel, 2012].


The utility of our probabilistic ROI (pROI) for localizing place-selective
voxels when fMRI data are or are not available
%
This pROI can be used to localize place-selective voxels when fMRI data are not
available.
%
We have cross-validated our pROI across participants and studies including the
identification of peak place selectivity in the CoS from data representing over
500 participants [Barch et al., 2013; Nasr et al., 2014] collected with
different voxel resolutions, stimuli, tasks, scanners, and analysis methods.
%
Thus, our probabilistic ROI is generalizable across many different
methodological decisions spanning experimental design, as well as fMRI data
acquisition and analyses [we do it even 'more extreme'].


However, this pROI is not perfect.
%
Additional analysis decisions such as the statistical threshold used, the
precise contrast, or the amount of spatial smoothing influence the spatial
extent of the ROI on the cortical surface.
%
Our pROI may not always identify the exact boundaries of the "PPA" but it will
always identify the most probable location of voxels with the highest place
selectivity within medial VTC.
%
The cortical location of these voxels is consistent with recent definitions of
the "anterior parahippocampal place area" [Baldassano et al., 2013; Silson et
al., 2016] and CoS-places [Weiner et al., 2010; Stigliani et al., 2015].

%
A prior approach [Julian et al., 2012] first anatomically identifies a large
cortical expanse in parahippocampal cortex, then restricts this expanse to a
smaller cortical extent that is place-selective when fMRI data are available.
%
These approaches complement one another and achieve different research
intentions:
%
the approach by [Julian et al., 2012] attempts to automate the identification of
the PPA from fMRI data, while the present approach aims to identify the most
probable location of place-selective voxels in VTC based on anatomical data even
when fMRI data are not available.

%
We believe that this approach will be particularly useful in patient populations
[e.g. blind individuals; Amedi et al., 2007; He et al., 2013; Mahon et al.,
2009; Wolbers et al., 2011] and intracranial studies [e.g. Bastin et al., 2013;
Davidesco et al., 2013; Engell and McCarthy, 2010; Jacques et al., 2015;
Megevand et al., 2014; Murphey et al., 2009; Rangarajan et al., 2014] in which
it may not be possible to obtain fMRI data, but high resolution anatomical MRI
data are typically obtained.

%
Having a probabilistic ROI of place selectivity in typical adults
can enable future studies to test differences across development [Cohen Kadosh
and Johnson, 2007; Golarai et al., 2007; Peelen et al., 2009; Scherf et al.,
2007; Gomez et al., 2017], lifespan [Park et al., 2012], or atypical populations
[Aguirre and D'Esposito, 1999; Epstein et al., 2001; Golarai et al., 2006;
Golarai et al., 2010a; Lind et al., 2013; Mendez and Cherrier, 2003].

%
Nevertheless, other empirical findings indicate that the PPA is not functionally
or anatomically homogenous.
%
Using a data-driven approach, [Cukur et al., 2016] showed that the PPA contains
differentiable voxel tuning for multiple semantic categories
%
[Arcaro et al., 2009] showed that the PPA is retinotopically heterogeneous as it
spans multiple retinotopic maps.
%
Importantly, we replicate these findings at the group level: our pROI of place
selectivity also spans several retinotopic maps as defined by [Wang et al. 2015]
(see Fig. 6).

%
Finally, comparing our pROI relative to a recent multimodal parcellation of the
brain [Glasser et al., 2016] shows that our pROI contains portions of six
different regions (Fig. 6).
%

Conclusion:
%
The present study shows that the location of place-selective voxels in medial
VTC relative to cortical folding is so consistent that it could be predicted
from a probabilistic ROI generated from independent groups of participants.
%
Findings extend recent results showing that cortical positions of
high-level visual areas in the ventral temporal lobe are reliably arranged
relative to the macroanatomy.
%
Our results are important because they reveal regularities in the functional
organization of high-level visual cortex, which is contrary to the assumption
that high inter-subject variability in functional-structural relationships is a
general feature of the organization of higher sensory cortices at the level of
areas.


\subsubsection{templates from \citet{zhen2017quantifying}}

\todo[inline]{use only volume-based alignment}

Abstract: Scene-selective regions (SSRs), including the parahippocampal place
area (PPA), retrosplenial cortex (RSC), and transverse occipital sulcus (TOS),
are functional regions in the human brain.
%
In a large group of healthy adults (N=202), we used fMRI to investigate
different aspects of topographical and functional variability within SSRs,
including interindividual differences.
%
PPA, RSC, and TOS were delineated manually for each individual.
%
We demonstrate that SSRs show substantial interindividual variability in both
spatial topography and functional selectivity.
%
We identified consistent interhemispheric differences in the spatial topography
of all three SSRs, but distinct interhemispheric differences in scene
selectivity.
%
We found that all three SSRs showed stronger scene selectivity in men than in
women.
%
Our work invites future work on the origin and functional significance of these
variabilities.
%
We constructed the first probabilistic atlases for the SSRs, which
provide the detailed anatomical reference for further investigations of the
scene network.

Specialized scene-processing areas:
%
These are the parahippocampal cortex (PHC, or parahippocampal place area [PPA])
[Aguirre et al., 1996; Epstein and Kanwisher, 1998], the retrosplenial complex
(RSC) [Bar and Aminoff, 2003; Maguire, 2001], and the transverse occipital
sulcus (TOS, or occipital place area [OPA]) [Dilks et al., 2013; Grill- Spector,
2003].
%
PPA may encode the spatial layout of the scenes [Epstein, 2008; Epstein et al.,
1999, 2007; Henderson et al., 2008; Kravitz et al., 2011; Park et al., 2011]
%
RSC may support memory retrieval for the location of a scene situated within the
broader spatial environment [Epstein, 2008; Epstein et al., 2007; Suzuki et al.,
1998; Wolbers and Buchel, 2005].
%
TOS may be involved in initial stages of scene processing [Aminoff and Tarr,
2015; Bettencourt and Xu, 2013; Dilks et al., 2013; MacEvoy and Epstein, 2007].

%
Most previous studies focus on spatial and functional commonalities within each SSR devoting very little effort to characterizing the variability of SSRs across
individuals.

%
One notable aspect of variability is interindividual difference in spatial
topography and functional selectivity of the SSRs.
%
Cytoarchitectonic mapping has revealed a considerable degree of intersubject
variability in the location and extent of anatomically defined regions
throughout the cortex [Amunts et al., 1999; Caspers et al., 2013; Scheperjans et
al., 2008; Zilles and Amunts, 2013].
%
Cortical surface reconstructions from structural MRI have also revealed
significant interindividual variability in cortical shape and folding [Fischl et
al., 2008; Hill et al., 2010; Van Essen and Dierker, 2007].

%
Only one study has characterized interindividual variability within the SSRs
[Frost and Goebel, 2012] (N=10) that revealed significant spatial variability in
the PPA.

The current study aimed to use fMRI to characterize such variabilities in all
three well-studied SSRs, and in a large sample of healthy subjects (N=202).
%
Subjects underwent scans while viewing navigationally relevant scenes.

%
1) all three SSRs were delineated manually for each individual in each
hemisphere.
%
2) the interindividual variability of SSRs was quantified in its spatial
topography and functional selectivity.

3) the interhemispheric and sex differences in the spatial topography and
functional selectivity were examined for the SSRs.

Subject-specific SSR delineation.
%
Subject-specific SSRs were delineated manually in the parcel unit based on the
individual activation map from the contrast of scenes versus objects.
%
The subject-specific activation image was first thresholded (Z>2.3, uncorrected)
and partitioned into many small parcels with the watershed algorithm:
%
The algorithm partitions an image by analogous process of a landscape being
flooded by water in which water seeps in from every local minimum and the
landscape is finally divided into multiple regions separated by the watersheds
[Meyer, 1994].

%
The activation map was treated as the landscape, and the watershed lines were
the borders among different local homogenous regions (parcels).
%
As a result, a set of parcels were generated from the partition.
%
Then, the raters handpicked the parcels on the individual activation map to
construct the SSRs following a standard procedure.
%
1) the gyri and sulcus from MNI152 template were used as the anatomical
landmarks to locate the SSRs coarsely [Nasr et al., 2011].
%
PPA was located near the lateral lip of the collateral sulcus and adjacent
medial fusiform gyrus.
%
TOS was centered on the lateral occipital gyrus, anterior and ventral to the
transverse occipital sulcus.
%
RSC was located in the fundus of the parieto-occipital sulcus.
%
2) we used the SSR group labels (the functional landmark) as a spatial
extent reference.
%
The major part of each candidate parcel overlapped with or neighbored to the
corresponding functional label.
%
3) From the parcels that showed good correspondence to both anatomical and
functional landmarks, we identified the one with the strongest scene-selective
activation as the center of a SSR, and iteratively merged the parcels which
connected with the selected parcels into the regions until no candidate parcels
met the criteria.
%
A specialized tool, called FreeROI (http://freeroi.brainactivityatlas.org), was
developed in Python to aid the raters in delineating regions of interest (ROI).

Interindividual Variability in SSRs.
%
Spatial topography.
%
To characterize the spatial variability of SSRs, a probabilistic atlas (or map)
was first created for each SSR, by calculating the frequency of a respective SSR
being present at a given position across all subjects.
%
The map coded the occurrence probability of each voxel being located in the SSR,
%
Thus, it provided a voxel-wise description for inter-individual variability in
the location and extent of that SSR.
%
In addition, a maximum-probability map (MPM) was constructed to integrate the
multiple probabilistic SSR maps into one map, and to characterize the spatial
relations among SSRs.
%
For each voxel, we compared its values from each probabilistic
map, and assigned that voxel to the SSR which showed the highest probability at
the voxel.
%
If one voxel showed equal probabilities for multiple SSRs, it would be assigned
to the SSR, which owned the highest average probability in the 26 immediate
neighbors of the voxel.
%
The voxels with a maximal probability below 10\% were set to 0, indicating that
they most likely did not belong to any SSR.
%
As a result, the MPM defined the most likely SSR to which each voxel belonged.

%
Interindividual variability of spatial topography of the SSRs was further
characterized according to the MNI stereotaxic coordinates of peak activation.
%
For each SSR, the coordinates of peak activation were identified in each
subject, and the mean coordinates of all peaks were calculated as the center of
the peak locations.
%
The standard deviation (SD) of the coordinates on each axis was calculated for
each SSR to measure the interindividual dispersion of the locations of peak
activation.
%
The sum of the three SDs for each SSR was further calculated as a measure of the
overall variability of peak locations in MNI stereotaxic space.

Results

Across individual brains, scene- selective activation varied dramatically in
location, extent, and magnitude.
%
SSRs were successfully delineated in a large proportion of subjects: PPA (RH:
97.5\%, and LH: 97.5\%), RSC (RH: 96.5\%, and LH: 98.0\%), and TOS (RH: 89.1\%,
and LH: 89.6\%).
%
The corresponding PPA and RSC delineated from the representative individual
activation map provided in Figure 1A are presented in Figure 1B (for the TOS,
see Supporting Information Fig. S2), and exemplify interindividual variability
of the SSRs in both location and extent.

Interindividual Variability of SSRs.
%
To quantify interindividual variability in the spatial topography of each SSR,
we created a probabilistic atlas for each one.
%
No voxel (i.e., 100\% certainty) was constantly identified as belonging to one
specific SSR (Fig. 3A).
%
The maximum probability of a particular voxel belonging to an SSR ranged from
0.39 to 0.90 (Table I).

%
High probability was always found in the center of the SSR.
%
Central voxels showed higher probability in the right hemisphere than those in
the left hemisphere for the RSC and TOS, whereas the reverse was observed for
the PPA (Fig. 3A), suggesting that spatial variability is different across
regions and hemispheres.

%
Because the probabilistic maps of adjacent SSRs (e.g., PPA and RSC) overlapped
to some degree in the periphery, a maximum-probability map (MPM) was then
created to obtain an integrated, non-overlapping map for all SSRs.
%
As shown in Figure 3B, the MPM revealed a clear topographical relationship
between these SSRs (Fig. 3B).
%
PPA was located on the lips of the collateral sulcus and the parahippocampal
gyrus, and abutted the medial fusiform gyrus.
%
RSC occupied the retrosplenial cortex, reaching to the PPA ventrally, and
extending superiorly along the parieto-occipital sulcus.
%
TOS occupied the lateral occipital gyrus and the transverse occipital sulcus.


%
Interindividual spatial variability was further characterized through measuring
the dispersion of the stereotaxic coordinates of a given SSRs peak activation.
%
As expected, substantial interindividual variations in peak location along all
three axes were observed.
%
The SDs of peak activation ranged from several millimeters to 1 cm in each axis,
for each SSR (Fig. 4A).
%
The sum of the SDs from the three axes was calculated for each SSR to quantify
its overall variability.
%
As shown in Figure 4B, the TOS varied the most overall (LH: 22.4 mm, and RH:
23.6 mm), then the RSC (LH: 19.5 mm, and RH: 21.3 mm) and finally the PPA (LH:
13.8 mm, and RH: 12.6 mm).
%
Thus, the peak activation of the SSRs showed significant interindividual
variability in spatial topography.

%
Besides spatial topography, interindividual functional variability was
characterized for each SSR according to the magnitude of scene-selective peak
activation.
%
Large interquartile ranges (IQR) were observed in scene selectivity for all SSRs
(Fig. 5), indicating that each SSR had significant interindividual variability
in its response (Fig. 5A).
%
When quantified by the CV, across hemispheres the SSRs on average showed CVs
around 0.45 (Fig. 5B).
%
Among them, the RSC (RH: 0.45, and LH: 0.52) showed greater variability than the
PPA (RH: 0.44, and LH: 0.38) and TOS (RH: 0.40, and LH: 0.44).

Discussion

We revealed three aspects of SSRs' variability.
%
1) SSRs showed considerable interindividual variability in both spatial
topography and functional selectivity.
%
2) SSRs showed significant interhemispheric differences in spatial topography
and functional selectivity.
%
3) SSRs exhibited significant sex differences in functional selectivity.

%
A probabilistic atlas was created to quantify the variability of SSRs, which
contained precise stereotaxic information on interindividual and
interhemispheric differences.

Interindividual Variability of SSRs.
%
Although it is widely acknowledged that there exists a considerable degree of
interindividual spatial variability in the functionally-defined regions.
%
Only one study has noted interindividual spatial variability in SSRs.
%
[Frost and Goebel 2012] revealed that the PPA demonstrated significant spatial
variability through constructing the probabilistic atlases of the PPA based on a
small sample size (N=10).
%
We extended this previous study in two ways:
%
1) our probability atlas included not just PPA but also RSC and TOS.
%
Atlases provide a comprehensive anatomical reference for the SSRs.
%
Atlases serve as a useful repository of knowledge and facilitate the mapping of
scene-related brain networks.
%
The maps could be used as norms to distinguish normal and pathological
variations, or to serve as spatial priors in identifying SSRs in new subjects.
%
2) We quantified the spatial variability in more detail, and identified
more than 20 mm divergence in the location of peak activation across subjects,
almost twice that in the face-selective regions (FSR) [Zhen et al., 2015].

%
Taken together, we provided the first comprehensive characterization of the
interindividual spatial variability for the three most-studied SSRs.

%
Besides spatial topography, the SSRs showed significant interindividual
variability in functional selectivity.

%
Previous studies have revealed remarkable variability in scene selectivity,
though most of these studies have not been studied in detail [Bettencourt and
Xu, 2013; Julian et al., 2012; Kornblith et al., 2013; Nasr et al., 2011].
%
We observed that the SSRs we studied showed remarkable variability in their
scene selectivity (CV=0.45), which again is nearly twice that seen for faces
in FSRs (CV=0.25) [Zhen et al., 2015].

%
Interestingly, we noticed that the SSRs showed larger interindividual
variability than the FSRs in both spatial topography and functional selectivity.
%
Why the distribution of this variability is regionally non-uniform remains
unclear, but one possibility is that natural scenes are themselves more variable
than well-structured faces.
%
Further studies are needed to elucidate the reason for the described regional
differences identified herein.

Limitations and Future Directions
%
1) The volume-based approach was used to define the individual SSR and generate
the probabilistic atlases.
%
The volume-based registration contains no model of the cortical surface, and may
fail to match the fine anatomy between subjects.
%
Residual macro-anatomical variability from volume-based registration may
confound the measured spatial variability of the SSRs.
%
Future work with advanced surface-based approach is likely to remove
macro-anatomical variability more thoroughly and make the measure for the
spatial variability of the functional regions more accurate [Frost and Goebel,
2012, 2013].
%
2) Variability was observed from a cohort of homogeneous young adults with a
narrow age range, which limits the generalization of the variability observed
here to people with different ages, especially children and the elderly.
%
Future studies are needed to characterize how the different aspects of
variability in SSRs change with ages.
%
3) Interindividual variability of functional regions may root in
multiple sources, such as variability in the cytoarchitecture [Zilles and
Amunts, 2013], hemodynamic response functions [Aguirre et al. 1998; Handwerker
et al. 2004], connectivity patterns [Mueller et al., 2013], functional
plasticity [Polley et al., 2006; Song et al., 2010], and genetic factors
[Blokland et al., 2011; Koten et al., 2009].
%
It is notable that the spatial variability of the SSRs seen here is nearly twice
that seen for the face-selective regions [Zhen et al., 2015]. How the multiple
sources may determine different interindividual variability of the functional
regions is another direction worthy of exploration in the future [make a point
of that in our discussion; check if you finde more about that in the study in
case you might deleted some parts].

Individual variability of face-selective regions (FSRs) has not been well

We use fMRI to localize the FSRs, and quantify their spatial and functional
variabilities in 202 healthy adults.

A probabilistic atlas was constructed to characterize interindividual

Variability of FSRs was further quantified on both functional (i.e., face
selectivity) and spatial (i.e., volume, location of peak activation, and
anatomical location) features.
%
Considerable interindividual variability and rightward asymmetry were found in
all FSRs on these features.

%
Our work presents the first effort to characterize variability of FSRs in a
large sample of healthy subjects,

% individual differences
It invites future work on the origin of the variability and its relation to
individual differences in behavioral performance.

%
The probabilistic functional atlas will provide an adequate spatial reference
for mapping the face network.

The human brain is characterized by striking interindividual variability in
structure and function [Frost and Goebel, 2012; Hasnain et al., 1998; Sugiura et
al., 2007; Van Essen and Dierker, 2007; Xiong et al., 2000; Zilles and Amunts,
2013].

Individual variability in functionally defined regions (i.e., homogenous regions
with specific response properties) is rarely quantified [Frost and Goebel, 2012;
Hasnain et al., 1998; Nieto-Castanon and Fedorenko, 2012; Saxe et al., 2006; Van
Horn et al., 2008].

The most reliable regions are located in the occipitotemporal cortex:
%
one in the inferior occipital gyrus (IOG): OFA (occipital face area) [Gauthier
et al., 2000; Liu et al., 2010].
%
three in the fusiform gyrus (FG): fusiform face area (FFA) in the posterior,
middle and anterior parts of the FG (i.e., pFFA, mFFA, and aFFA) [Engell and
McCarthy, 2013; Gauthier et al., 1999; Kanwisher et al., 1997; Nestor et al.,
2011; Weiner and Grill-Spector, 2010].
%
three in the superior temporal sulcus (STS): in the posterior continuation of
the STS (pcSTS), the posterior STS (pSTS), and the anterior STS (aSTS) [Pinsk et
al., 2009; Pitcher et al., 2011a; Puce et al., 1998].

%
FSRs are thought to process different aspects of faces [Haxby et al., 2000].
%
The region located in the IOG is involved in early perception of facial
features.
%
Regions located in the FG analyze the invariant aspects of faces that underlie
recognition of individuals [Kanwisher et al., 1997; McCarthy et al., 1997;
Pitcher et al., 2011b].
%
Regions located in the STS process the changeable aspects of faces such as
expressions [Phillips et al., 1997], direction of eye gaze, and lip movements,
for facilitating social communication [Allison et al., 2000; Hoffman and Haxby,
2000; Lahnakoski et al., 2012; Puce et al., 1998].

%
Previous studies have mostly focused on common properties of the FSRs across
individuals.
%
Interindividual variability of the FSRs is rarely investigated, although the
variability has commonly been observed in previous studies [Fox et al., 2009;
Goffaux et al., 2011; Kanwisher et al., 1997; Pinsk et al., 2009].
%
Four groups recently begun to develop probabilistic atlases (or maps) to
characterize the variability of face-selective activation [Engell and McCarthy,
2013; Frost and Goebel, 2012; Julian et al., 2012; Tahmasebi et al., 2012].
%
Three of them [Engell and McCarthy, 2013; Julian et al., 2012; Tahmasebi et al.,
2012] constructed the atlases at the voxel level, not at the FSR level.
%
Therefore, they didn't characterize the interindividual variability of the FSRs,
which is critical information for understanding the structural-functional
correspondence in the brain.
%
[Frost and Goebel, 2012] created an atlas (of FFA) at the FSR level but work is
only based on 10 subjects.
%
It is unclear how representative the atlas is and what the spatial relation
among the FSRs is (to what extend does the FFA overlap with the OFA?).

%
We identifying six well-studied FSRs in each individual of a large cohort of
subjects.
%
We constructed a probabilistic atlas of the FSRs to characterize its spatial and
functional variabilities.

%
We scanned 202 subjects with a robust dynamic face localizer [Fox et al., 2009;
Pitcher et al., 2011a] in the same scanner and with the same MR protocol.
%
1) Six well-studied FSRs, the OFA, pFFA, aFFA, pcSTS, pSTS, and aSTS, were
delineated in each individual using a semi-automated procedure.
%
2) A probabilistic atlas was created to quantify the spatial variability of
FSRs, which contained precise stereotaxic information on both interhemispheric
and interindividual differences.
%
3) Functional and spatial variabilities of the FSRs were characterized on four
features, a) face selectivity, b) volume, c) location of peak activation, and d)
anatomical location.
%

Localizer paradigm
%
A dynamic face localizer was used to define the FSRs.
%
Empirical evidence indicates that the task could elicit reliable activations of
FSRs across subjects [Fox et al., 2009; Pitcher et al., 2011a].
%
Data were acquired over three blocked-design functional runs, each of which
lasted 198 s.
%
Each run contained two block sets, intermixed with three 18-s rest blocks at the
beginning, middle and end of the run.
%
Each block set consisted of four blocks of four stimulus categories (i.e.,
faces, scenes, objects, and scrambled objects), with each stimulus category
presented in an 18-s block.
%
Each block contained six 3-s movie clips from an object category, which were
randomly drawn from a pool of 60 clips [cf. Pitcher et al., 2011a].
%

Subject-specific FSR delineation

We focused on the FSRs located in the occipitotemporal cortex, including OFA,
pFFA, aFFA, pcSTS, pSTS, and aSTS.
%
Of note, our data did not allow the differentiation of the pFus-faces and
mFus-faces (Engell and McCarthy, 2013; Pinsk et al., 2009; Weiner and
Grill-Spector, 2010) because most subjects showed only one cluster spanning from
the posterior to middle FG.
%
Moreover, for subjects who did show multiple clusters here, we often had trouble
classifying them as either pFus- faces or mFus-face, possibly because of the low
resolution of our fMRI data or the spatial smoothing used in the analysis
[Weiner and Grill- Spector, 2011].
%
Another possibility is that the dynamic stimuli were not efficient for
differentiating the pFus-faces and mFus-faces, as a previous study showed that
fusiform face regions are more sensitive to static than to dynamic information
[Pitcher et al., 2011a].
%
Therefore, we defined the clusters that spanned from the posterior to middle FG
as a single region (i.e., the pFFA).

The subject-specific FSRs were delineated by seven raters specializing in the
ventral visual pathway.
%
Three sources of maps were used in combination in the delineating procedure,
namely the subject-specific activation map, an FSR spatial reference, and a
macro-anatomical landmark reference.
%
The subject-specific activation map was the statistical images derived from the
three-run fixed effect analysis providing information on subject-specific
activations
%
The FSR spatial reference was a map of the high-probability parcels derived from
the probabilistic activation map for face recognition (Fig. S1) [Zhen et al.,
2013] providing functional landmarks for the location and extent.
%
The macroanatomical landmark reference was provided by the MNI152 T1 template
providing macro-anatomical landmarks for the location and extent.

%
A semi-automated delineation procedure was followed by all raters, illustrated
in Fig. 1.
%
1) subject-specific activation image for faces versus objects was
thresholded with Z=2.3 (p=0.01, right tailed, uncorrected) and then overlaid
on the FSR spatial reference map (Fig. 1A).
%
The thresholded Z=2.3 was adopted in light of empirical evidence suggesting
that a lenient statistical threshold could help to identify functional regions
in cases of relatively small amounts of data [Kawabata Duncan and Devlin, 2011].
%
2) thresholded activation image was partitioned into many small parcels
using the watershed algorithm [Meyer, 1994](Fig. 1B).
%
3) raters handpicked the small parcels from the watershed to construct
the target regions based simultaneously on the FSR spatial reference and the
macroanatomical landmark reference (Figs. 1B and C).

%
A specialized tool, called FreeROI [http://www.brainactivityatlas.org], was
developed in Python to aid the raters in delineating regions of interest (ROI)
with our procedure.

%
Our semi-automated delineation procedure has three major advantages over the
traditional handpicking method.
%
1) boundaries between parcels are objectively determined with the
watershed algorithm, which avoids subjectivity in determining the boundaries of
the FSRs.
%
2) guided by the spatial reference of the FSRs and macroanatomical landmark
references, the FSRs could be identified more accurately.
%
3) delineating the FSRs in parcel units rather than in voxel units as in the
traditional method can save a great deal of time.

%
Seven raters took part in delineating the FSRs in four rounds.

%
1) brains were randomly divided into seven approximately equal groups and each
rater was assigned to delineate the FSRs for a group of brains.
%
2) each rater was assigned to delineate the FSRs for another group of brains;
%
as a results, each FSR had been delineated twice with two different raters.
%
3) the delineated FSRs from the first two rounds were double checked and refined
by the two raters who had delineated them.
%
4) FSRs that failed to reach the agreement of the two raters were evaluated and
then finalized by all seven raters together.


Characterization of interindividual variability
%
We created a probabilistic atlas to characterize the locations and extents (or
borders) of the FSRs precisely
%
We then quantified the variability of the FSRs on both functional (i.e., face
selectivity) and spatial (i.e., volume, location of peak activation, and
functional anatomy) features.

Probabilistic atlas
%
For each FSR, a probabilistic map was created to characterize the likelihood
that a given voxel belonged to that FSR.
%
The subject-specific FSR delineated in individual brains were averaged in the
MNI152 space so that the value at any voxel coded the likelihood of the voxel
being located in the FSR, thus giving a measure of the variability in location
and extent of the FSR over subjects at voxel-level resolution.

%
Because of the interindividual variability, the probabilistic maps from adjacent
FSRs often showed some overlap.
%
A maximum-probability map (MPM) was constructed to summarize the probabilistic
maps of all FSRs into one volume.
%
The MPM was constructed by comparing the probabilities for each FSR (i.e., the
overlapping frequency) in each voxel and assigning that voxel to the FSR to
which it had the highest probability of belonging.
%
If two FSRs showed equal probabilities, the problematic voxel was assigned to
the FSR with the higher average probability in the 26 immediately adjacent
voxels.
%
The voxels with a maximal probability smaller than 10\% were set to 0,
indicating that they most likely did not belong to any FSR.
%
Result: MPM defined the most likely FSR to which each voxel belonged and
represented all FSRs in a continuous, but non-overlapping manner in one volume.

%
Face selectivity was characterized as percent signal change (PSC) for the
contrast of faces versus objects.
%
First, PSC was calculated for each voxel by dividing the estimates of the
parameters (the contrast of beta values from the fixed-effects GLM) by the mean
intensity of the baseline level (the intercept in the GLM), and multiplying by
100.
%
Second, PSC for an FSR was then calculated as the mean of PSC values across all
voxels within the FSR.

%
Interhemispheric difference in face selectivity was assessed with the paired
t-test, and the effect size was measured with Cohen's d.

%
Interindividual variability in face selectivity was quantified by the
coefficient of variation (CV = SD/mean) separately for each FSR.
%
Permutation tests were used to test the significance of hemispheric effects on
the CV of the magnitude.

%
The volume of an FSR was measured as the number of voxels within the FSR
multiplied by the voxel size within the MNI space.
%
The region size measured in the MNI space is equivalent to normalizing
individual region volumes by total intracranial volume (TIV) and therefore
avoids the confounding effect of TIV variation [Buckner et al., 2004].

%
A significant effect of hemisphere on the volume was tested using the paired
t-test, and the effect size was measured with Cohen's d.

%
Interindividual variability in volume was quantified by the CV separately for
each FSR.
%
Permutation tests were used to test the significance of hemispheric effects on
the CV of the volume.

Results

Delineation of FSRs.
%
Subject-specific FSRs were delineated based on the individual activation map
with a parcel-based delineation procedure.
%
Face-selective activation showed dramatic variation in the location, extent, and
strength across individual brains (Fig 2A).
%
With our specialized tool, FreeROI, approximately 10 min were required for an
expert to delineate all 12 FSRs in a brain.

%
The OFA, pFFA, aFFA, pcSTS, pSTS, and aSTS in the right and left hemispheres
were identified in 189/169, 198/187, 113/107, 169/140, 201/192, and 191/176 of
202 brains, respectively (Table 1).


Reliability of the delineation was measured using the Dice's coefficient.
%
All FSRs showed good intra-rater reliability with Dice's coefficients
approximately equal to or exceeding 0.7 (Fig. 3).
%
Particularly, OFA, pFFA, and pSTS showed intra-rater reliability close to or
higher than 0.9.
%
The inter-rater reliability of the delineation is comparable to the intra-rater
reliability, with Dice's coefficients exceeding 0.7 in most of the FSRs except
left pcSTS, left aSTS, and right aSTS.
%
No significant difference between inter- and intra-rater reliability was found
(p b 0.05, Bonferroni correction).
%
Remarkably, the reliability is comparable to the reported reliabilities of some
manually labeled anatomical regions, such as the amygdala and hippocampus [Entis
et al., 2012; Geuze et al., 2005], though the boundaries of the functional
regions were not as clear as the boundaries of the anatomical regions.
%
In summary, the raters had stable performance while delineating each FSR, and
the delineations from different raters were highly consistent.

A probabilistic atlas of the FSRs was created by calculating the probability of
a respective FSR being present at a given position to characterize the
interindividual variability of the locations and extents (or borders) of the
FSRs.
%
The probabilistic atlas consists of a set of 12 probability maps that reflect
the interindividual variability of the respective FSRs.
%
High interindividual variability was observed for all FSRs: no one voxel showed
a 100-percent chance of being in one of the FSRs across subjects (Fig. 4A, a).
%
Maximum probability that a voxel belonged to an FSR ranged from 0.24 (left aFFA)
to 0.74 (right pSTS) (Table 1).


For each FSR, high probability was often found in the center, not the periphery.
%
Voxels in the center of the right FSRs usually had a larger probability than
those of their left counterparts, especially for pFFA, pcSTS, and pSTS (Fig.
4A), suggesting that the FSRs in the left hemisphere have a larger variability
in terms of anatomical location.

%
Because of the large interindividual variability, the probabilistic maps of
adjacent FSRs showed overlaps to some extent in the periphery.
%
To classify each voxel to the most likely region, an MPM was created to obtain a
non-overlapping representation of the FSRs.
%
MPM represents multiple FSRs in one volume, which reveals a basic topographical
pattern of these FSRs (Fig. 4B).


Discussion

We have delineated the subject-specific FSRs in a large fMRI dataset and
revealed that FSRs showed considerable variability across individuals and
hemispheres with respect to face selectivity, volume, location of peak
activation, and anatomical correspondence.

%
A probabilistic atlas was created to quantify the spatial variability
of FSRs, which contained precise stereotaxic information.


Interindividual variability of the FSRs.
%
Results reveal that the FSRs showed considerable interindividual variability
in both functional and spatial features.
%
As for the functional features, the FSRs showed significant variability in their
selectivity for faces, consistent with previous studies [Furl et al., 2011;
Gauthier et al., 2005; Yovel and Kanwisher, 2005].

%
Only a few studies provided quantitative estimates of intersubject variability
of the FSRs, mostly focusing on the variability of the location of peak
activation.
%
The interindividual variability of peak location of FSRs reportedly ranged from
several millimeters to centimeters [Fox et al., 2009; Kanwisher et al., 1997;
Pinsk et al., 2009].
%
Interindividual variability in the volume of FSRs was also
examined either in subjects' native space [Kanwisher et al., 1997; Pinsk et al.,
2009] or by fixing the size of the FFA at 200 mm3 [Rossion et al., 2012],
resulting in a finding that the interindividual variability of the volume (i.e.,
the SD of the volume measurements) is approximately equal to or greater than the
mean volume of each FSR.

%
Our study extended these studies on the spatial features of the FSRs in three
folds.
%
1) the probabilistic atlas revealed that the FSRs had high uncertainty in
location and extent:
%
not one voxel in an FSR was found to show face selectivity in all participants
tested.
%
2) distance among the locations of peak activation across participants
in an FSR was more than 10 mm.
%
3) interindividual variability in the volumes of the FSRs (CV: 0.67-0.90)
was dramatically larger than that of the mean volume of the total neocortex (CV:
about 0.1) [Kennedy et al., 1998].

We standardized all individual brains to the MNI152 space with a
high dimensional non-linear registration method.
%
Even with an arguably more accurate curvature-based alignment, the
variability of functional regions remains prominent (Frost and Goebel, 2012).
%
Therefore, the observed variability likely reflected the true functional
variability (i.e., the structural– functional correspondence).
%
Such interindividual functional variability likely provides a neural basis for
interindividual differences in face recognition.
%
a) individual differences in face selectivity of the OFA and FFA
predict differences in behavioral performance in face recognition [Furl et al.,
2011; Huang et al., 2014].
%
b) differences in the volume of the FFA were found to account for the
developmental differences in face recognition memory [Golarai et al., 2007].

[we, behavioral differences in navigation?]


Probabilistic functional atlas (PFA).
%
Atlases of the human brain play an important role in brain research.
%
An atlas captures the spatiotemporal distribution of a multitude of
physiological and anatomical metrics in a stereotaxic space [Evans et al., 2012;
Toga et al., 2006].
%
A series of brain atlases has been created and widely used [Evans et al., 2012;
Mazziotta et al., 2001; Mori et al., 2008; Shattuck et al., 2008; Zilles and
Amunts, 2010].

%
Most of the existing atlases focus on brain anatomy, not brain
functions.
%
Because of great intersubject variability in anatomy and structural-functional
correspondence, the anatomical atlases are not sufficient to allow researchers
to infer the location and extent of functional regions and their variability
across individual brains [Frost and Goebel, 2012].

%
The lack of brain atlases for functional regions renders it difficult to
accumulate accurate knowledge of specific functional regions and to understand
the structural and functional architecture of the face processing system.

One contribution of our study is the construction of a probabilistic functional
atlas for the FSRs based on a large cohort of subjects.
%
A probabilistic functional atlas could serve as a useful repository of knowledge
and facilitate the analysis of fMRI data [Evans et al., 2012; Mazziotta et al.,
2001].

1) as a complement to the anatomical atlases, the atlas supplies a quantitative
spatial reference system in which information from multiple sources can be
integrated and compared.
%
By integrating with other atlases, the probabilistic functional atlas would
identify patterns of structural, connectional, and molecular variations in the
functional regions and provide a deeper understanding of the relationship
between brain structure and function.
%
2) subject-specific fROIs are always preferred over the probabilistic functional
atlas based fROIs in individual studies;
%
however, when such information is not available, the probabilistic functional
atlas can be used to provide face-selective fROIs in group analyses to explore
properties common to all human brains.
%
On the other hand, even when a functional localizer is acquired, the
probabilistic functional atlas can be used as a source of spatial constraints to
localize subject-specific fROIs.
%
Availability of well-defined fROIs could provide better sensitivity and
specificity in integrating features of the FSRs with clinical and genetic data,
and in studying the large-scale brain network for face recognition.
%
3) individual FSRs and associated features could serve as a
database of the FSRs in a healthy population.
%
All the accumulated data in the atlas could be used as a norm to quantify the
degree of deviation of the FSRs in a new subject and thereby have the potential
to detect FSR deficits in patients.
%
4) the atlas descriptions of intersubject variance in FSRs could serve as
empirical priors in the development of algorithms for automated identification
of the FSRs.
%
The automated algorithms will in turn improve the objectivity and efficiency of
identification of the FSRs in new subjects.
%
Several groups have recently begun developing probabilistic atlases (or maps) to
characterize face-selective activation [Engell and McCarthy, 2013; Julian et
al., 2012; Tahmasebi et al., 2012].

%
Our probabilistic functional atlas significantly extended these atlases.
%
1) previous atlases aim to describe the likelihood of activation of each voxel
elicited by faces and thus provide little information on how the FSRs vary in
location and extent across subjects [but see Frost and Goebel, 2012].
%
Instead of characterizing the interindividual variability at the voxel level,
our study summarized the subject-specific FSRs across subjects to classify
face-selective voxels to a specific FSR.
%
The atlas at the regional level likely provides information more directly
related to cognitive processes of interest.
%
2) delineation of multiple regions together provides information about the
spatial and functional organizations of these regions, which makes comparison of
their anatomical and functional relations possible.
%
The former type of atlases characterize the interindividual variability of
activation for the cognitive process of interest at the voxel level, and the
latter type of atlases characterize the interindividual variability of the
functional regions that are involved in the cognitive process of interest.
%
The two types of atlases together could be the cornerstone of functional
atlases, in which brain regions are annotated according to their cognitive and
behavioral involvements.

Unwanted sources of variability.
%
Some of the observed spatial variability might stem from unwanted sources of
variability.
%
1) although a high-dimensional non-linear registration method was used to remove
macro-anatomical variability, some may remain.
%
A more advanced alignment scheme needs to be developed to better remove
macro-anatomical variability [Avants et al., 2011; Frost and Goebel, 2012,
2013], although perfect alignment of any two brains may not possible [Juch et
al., 2005; Van Essen and Dierker, 2007].
%
2) the low power of the localizer data may cause some variability.
%
Our functional localizer consists of three runs that take a relatively short
scanning period (~ 10 min).
%
Results from previous studies have revealed that this amount of data can well
localize the FSRs in individuals (70–80\% overlap with the gold standard from a
random-effects analysis of ten runs), the low signal-to-noise ratio of fMRI may
still lead to some unreliable FSR identifications [Kawabata Duncan and Devlin,
2011; Swallow et al., 2003].
%
3) the choice of the threshold in localizing the FSRs inevitably influenced the
amount of variation in the location of the FSRs.
%
To avoid bias from a single arbitrary threshold, we also constructed the
probabilistic functional atlas using other commonly used Z thresholds such as
3.09 (i.e., p = 0.001, right tailed, uncorrected) and 3.71 (i.e., p = 0.0001,
right tailed, uncorrected) (Fig. S3),
%
As shown, the probabilistic atlas and maximum probability map derived at
different thresholds revealed similar patterns, indicating that our atlas is
stable and not sensitive to the choice of threshold.
%
4) the inter-rater inconsistency in labeling is another factor potentially
contributing unwanted variability, although our procedure of requiring the
collaboration of two raters on each labeling dramatically reduced this type of
variability.
%
The reliability of our delineation had reached a good level, comparable to the
reliabilities of some manually delineated anatomical regions, such as the
amygdala and hippocampus [Entis et al., 2012; Geuze et al., 2005].

Future directions.
%
The large variability of FSRs presented here suggests several avenues for future
study.
%
1) our definition of the FSRs relied on the functional contrast between faces
and objects.
%
When more information is introduced to define the FSRs, we may have more power
to distinguish the different regions [e.g., pFus and mFus].
%
Considering the connectivity patterns of regions of interest is a noteworthy
future direction in refining the PFA for faces processing.
%
2) Interindividual variability of functional regions in both functional and
spatial features should reflect brain function to some extent, and thus is a
rich and important source of information for revealing the neural basis of human
cognition and behavior [Kanai and Rees, 2011; Zilles and Amunts, 2013].
%
Future studies need to elaborate on the significance of the variability of
functional regions and utilize this variability to explore the neural mechanisms
of specific behavioral or cognitive processes [Van Horn et al., 2008].


\subsubsection{templates from \citet{frost2012measuring}}

Abstract: ``The central question of the relationship between structure and
function in the human brain is still not well understood.
%
In order to investigate this fundamental relationship we create functional
probabilistic maps from a large set of mapping experiments.
%
We compare the location of functionally localized regions across subjects using
different whole-brain alignment schemes.
%
All subjects are scanned using the same paradigms, the same scanner and the same
analysis pipeline (to avoid the major problems associated with meta-analysis
approaches).
%
We show that an advanced, curvature driven cortex based alignment (CBA) scheme
largely removes macro-anatomical variability across subjects.
%
Remaining variability in the observed spatial location of functional regions,
thus, reflects the "true" functional variability:
%
the quantified variability is a good estimator of the underlying
structural-functional correspondence.
%
We localized 13 widely studied functional areas and found a large variability in
the degree to which functional areas respect macro-anatomical boundaries across
the cortex.
%
Some areas, such as the frontal eye fields (FEF) are strongly bound to a
macro-anatomical location.
%
Fusiform face area (FFA) on the other hand, varies in its location along the
length of the fusiform gyrus even though the gyri themselves are well aligned
across subjects.
%
Language areas were found to vary greatly across subjects whilst a high degree
of overlap was observed in sensory and motor areas''.

Introduction
%
What is the relationship between structure and function in the human cerebral
cortex?
%
The creation of probabilistic maps based on the data from a large cohort of
brains is probably the most powerful way to approach this question.
%
Abundant data obtained in mapping experiments in different labs to carry out a
meta-analysis could be used to create probabilistic maps.
%
A meta-analytic approach however, would be sub-optimal as it would introduce
unwanted sources of variability.
%
1) different alignment and normalization schemes,
%
2) different experimental paradigms,
%
3) differences related to inconsistencies in analysis methods and thresholds
used across studies [Thirion et al., 2007].


Spatial normalization.
%
Spatial correspondence between subjects is a mandatory condition for meaningful
whole brain group analysis.

The most widely used normalization procedures automatically morph an individual
subject to fit a template brain.
%
The two most commonly used volumetric normalization procedures are
%
a) transformation to Talairach space, based on the classic stereotactic atlas
created by Talairach and Tournoux from one post-mortem examination [Talairach
and Tournoux, 1980] or
%
b) transformation to the MNI template space [Evans et al., 1992, 1993].
%
These normalization techniques provide a means by which one can compare
activated brain regions across studies as results can be reported in terms of a
three dimensional co-ordinate system (x, y, and z position in mm).

Anatomical correspondence.
%
Talairach and MNI normalization procedures have severe drawbacks.
%
The major problem being that the same coordinate can refer to different
anatomical areas across subjects.
%
Even on visual inspection one can see that, despite being normalized to
Talairach space, the brains still have very different cortical folding patterns.

%
The problem of macro-anatomical alignment lies in the fact that the human
neocortex is essentially a two dimensional sheet, which is only a few
millimeters thick.
%
The cortical surface is highly folded to allow it to squeeze into the restricted
cranial cavity and, although there are many consistencies across subjects, each
individual has a unique sulcal and gyral folding pattern.
%
Approaches that explicitly align the folding pattern of the cortical surface
[Fischl et al., 1999b; Goebel et al., 2006] appear more promising to obtain
optimal macro-anatomical alignment.


Surface-based cortex alignment.
%
[Fischl et al., 1999b] showed that manual landmarks were not necessary for
macro-anatomical alignment but a local curvature-based optimization criterion
was used on spherical cortex representations.
%
The curvature-based alignment method demonstrated much improved macro-anatomical
correspondence across brains and provided first evidence of improved concomitant
alignment of histiologically defined Brodman areas [Fischl et al., 2008].

%
[Pantazis et al. 2010] compared the performance of landmark based registration,
where a set of manually defined macro-anatomical landmarks act as targets of
alignment, and curvature based registration, which automatically extracts
curvature information from each individual cortical mesh and uses local
curvature deviations to drive alignment.

%
Even among brains of healthy subjects, large variation in size, shape and
orientation of gyri and sulci is difficult to reconcile using automatic
curvature driven alignment.
%
The added flexibility of landmark based registration is very useful when one
considers the fact that there is not always a one-to-one relationship between
the number of sulci and gyri across subjects.
%
For example, it is well known that there is variation in the number of
transverse temporal gyri across subjects, with some subjects possessing a
doubling of this structure [Leonard et al., 1998].

Landmark based alignment schemes also have disadvantages however.
%
1) time consuming to manually label landmarks.
%
2) to accurately manually label landmarks requires a significant amount of
anatomical knowledge and lastly, the personal interaction in the alignment
introduces the possibility of subjective labeling influencing the resulting
registration.

%
In comparison, curvature based alignment is relatively fast:
%
1) as long as one starts with high quality cortical surface mesh reconstructions
an automatic alignment can be completed in a matter of minutes,
%
2) it does not require detailed anatomical knowledge and that it operates
largely automatically,
%
3) CBA creates reproducible results with respect to a defined objective function
leaving no room for experimenter bias and error to influence the alignment.

Functional correspondence.
%
We investigate the relationship between structure and function in the brain.
%
We evaluate the degree of spatial correspondence of functionally homologue
specialized brain areas across subjects with respect to different anatomical
alignment schemes.

%
Spatial correspondence is quantified through the creation of probabilistic maps
and assessment of the geodesic distance between homologue areas.

%
Volume-based registration techniques are unable to account for individual
differences in cortical folding.
%
We expect a higher degree of variation in the location of functional areas when
brains are registered in volume space than when the same brains are registered
with advanced surface driven techniques.

%
If advanced curvature/landmark-based alignment largely
removes macroanatomical variability then the calculated
probabilistic maps and distance measurements should largely reflect the true
variability of the location of functionally defined homologue brain areas.

%
The common approach to solve the problem of poor overlap of functional regions
when carrying out a whole-brain group study is to spatially smooth data,
typically with a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm full width at half maximum.
%
However as fMRI imaging techniques advance and data is acquired at an
increasingly finer scale, smoothing in effect discards a vast amount of
potentially useful data [Kriegeskorte et al., 2006].

%
With an expected increase of spatial correspondence between functional areas
across subjects, advanced surface based alignment techniques promise more
powerful group statistics without the need to extensively smooth functional
data.

%
[Fischl et al., 2008] investigated the relationship between cortical folding and
underlying cytoarchitecture.
%
The present study investigates the relationship between cortical folding and the
location of functionally specialized brain areas.

%
In light of the potential issues of curvature-based cortical alignment [Pantazis
et al., 2010] we first did a thorough investigation into our cortex based
curvature alignment scheme to ensure that we significantly increased
correspondence of macro-anatomical landmarks across subjects and that no major
sulci were misaligned.
%
Then functional probabilistic maps were calculated in volume (Talairach) space
and aligned cortex (surface) space based on 10 subjects using 8 localization
experiments to label 13 functional areas.


Anatomical alignment.

All anatomical volumes and functional time series were first warped into
Talairach space.

%
This operation included the definition of the landmarks AC (anterior
commissure), PC (posterior commissure) and the borders of the cerebrum; the
defined subject-specific landmarks were then used to rotate each brain in the
AC–PC plane followed by piece-wise, linear transformations to fit each brain in
the common Talairach “proportional grid” system [Talairach and Tournoux, 1980].

%
An automatic segmentation procedure was applied leading to the creation of
topologically correct cortical surface reconstructions [Kriegeskorte and Goebel,
2001].
%
Curvature maps, which are important for mesh morphing operations, were
calculated on the folded representations.
%
[...] In this way CBA does not align each subject's curvature to a static
template but to a dynamic group average that itself reflects the progress of
macro-anatomical alignment.

Functional localizers — area identification.
%
Thirteen functional regions of interest were defined by performing general
linear model (GLM) analysis of time course data sampled on individual cortex
meshes.
%
In order to map fMRI signal time courses from volume space to surface
space, values located between the grey/white matter boundary and up to 3 mm into
grey matter towards the pial surface were sampled with trilinear interpolation
and averaged resulting in a single value for each vertex of a cortex mesh.

Functional areas of interest were determined by selecting the activity cluster
on the surface falling in the region reported in previous standard localizer
studies (see below).

%
Once the resulting cortical patches of interest (POIs) have been marked and
labeled it is possible to project the co-ordinates of a POI's vertices back
into the anatomical volume in order to produce a corresponding functional
volume-of-interest (VOI) in Talairach space [they project back into volume].
%
Finally, the POIs defined in individual cortex space can be adjusted using the
transformation parameters obtained from the CBA process, resulting in functional
regions in macro-anatomically aligned cortex space.
%
The overlap of POIs across subjects can thus, be compared between volume space
and (aligned) cortical surface space.

%
Since in the outlined procedure the extent of identified clusters – and thus the
overlap calculation – depends on subjectively determined thresholds, we also
implemented an alternative, completely objective method:
%
In this approach the location of the peak vertex within the active cluster of
each subject is determined per area and the shortest distance of each subject's
peak vertex to the mean location of the peak vertices is calculated.
%
The shortest distances (geodesics) of the peak vertices to the group average
location were calculated on the folded group mesh using the Dijkstra algorithm
[Cormen et al., 2001, Section 24.3: Dijkstra's algorithm. pp. 595–601].
%
The distances of the peak vertices to the group average location are calculated
before and after alignment.
%
Hence, this method allows one to quantify, for each homologue area, how much CBA
is able to increase spatial correspondence across subjects without requiring
subject-specific adjustments of statistical thresholds.

Quantifying POI overlap.
%
We computed the overlap of functional areas across subjects for vertices
belonging to a POI of at least one subject using the formula: Nv/N.
%
Nv is the number of subjects whose functional area includes vertex v,
%
N is the number of subjects.
%
The obtained values for all relevant vertices constitute the probabilistic map
for a particular localized region-of-interest.
%
An overall probabilistic map is obtained by adding the resulting overlap vertex
values for all included POIs.
%
A threshold of N=10\% is applied to all probabilistic maps to avoid depicting
regions as "overlap" where only one subject has a functional area.

Results

Functional overlap results.
%
All included functional regions showed increased overlap in the probabilistic
maps after CBA compared to volume based maps.
%
The percent gain in overlap differed greatly across the different functional
regions throughout the cortex.
%
A large amount of variability remained in language regions in the left
hemisphere (Fig. 5).
%
Both the sensory and motor hand areas (bank of the central sulcus) were much
better aligned after CBA.

%
Projecting the data on the surface increased the distinction between the areas
but it is only after accounting for individual curvature patterns using CBA that
these two functional regions become clearly separated.

%
Other motor regions exhibited smaller gains (SMA, PMA).
%
Similar to results described above, CBA is able to separate functional regions
which are more prone to blur together if individual anatomical curvature
patterns are not accounted for.

%
The area which shows the most gain in overlap of these regions is V5 / hMT+ with
70.9\% gain in the left hemisphere and 55.6\% gain in the right hemisphere.

%
Area LOC also showed increased overlap after CBA with a 62.7\% gain in the left
hemisphere and 38.4\% on the right.
%
Finally PPA exhibit more gain in the right hemisphere with 27.7\% gain, than on
the left with 17.6\%.

%
The fusiform face area (FFA) on the other hand, does not exhibit the same strong
structural–functional correspondence and saw more modest increases in overlap
after macro-anatomical alignment with 44.1\% and 12\% gain for the left and
right hemispheres, respectively.
%
The FFA is a functional area which receives much attention due to its role in
face processing [e.g. Grill-Spector et al., 2004; Kanwisher et al., 1999; Tarr
and Gauthier, 2000; Weiner and Grill-Spector, 2010].
%
Its location showed a very interesting pattern across subjects.
%
As seen in Fig.  9, there is much more inter-subject variability than in FEF.

Discussion.
%
We substantially reducing macro-anatomical variability of the cortex through
curvature driven surface alignment.
%

%
In order to investigate structural-functional correspondence through the
creation of probabilistic functional maps, it is crucial to achieve whole brain
macro-anatomical correspondence across subjects.

%
Our careful examination of the efficacy of CBA has shown that automatic
curvature based alignment techniques can align landmarks with very high
accuracy.

%
Curvature driven alignment may even outperform landmark-based cortex
alignment in achieving overall correspondence as alignment is not limited to a
subset of regions (landmarks) but rather utilizes curvature information from the
entire cortical sheet to achieve alignment.
%
It is imperative, however, that the results of an automatic alignment be
examined and not just assumed to have produced an accurate group alignment.

%
Those sulci that did not seem to exhibit a reduction in variability after CBA
were also those that were difficult to label, including very short landmarks
(paracentral sulcus), or sulci located very close to parallel sulci (lateral
orbital sulcus).
%
It is thus possible that the macro-anatomy in these respective regions is, in
actual fact, well aligned but this not reflected well due to mislabeling.
%
This highlights the difficulty in labeling landmarks, especially those with
multiple interruptions.
%
The gain in overlap of functional areas that are located close to such landmarks
are likely underestimating the true gain and should be considered preliminary.

%
Our data show that there is a surprising amount of variability in that not all
functional areas are tightly bound to anatomical landmarks, i.e. there is no
general rule describing how macroanatomical and functional areas correlate.
%
Indeed in some regions there is a strong structural-functional correspondence
whilst in others the spatial location of the functional area varies greatly
across subjects within a cortical area.

%
Whilst it seems that CBA has brought the functional area FEF into alignment,
there is a substantial amount of variability in FFA.
%
This remaining variability in the spatial location of FFA is likely to be caused
by two factors.
%
1) CBA aligns macro-anatomical curvature.
%
Hence, there is much less alignment force along the length of a sulcus or gyrus
(rather constant curvature values) than perpendicular to its extension (varying
curvature values) leading to less good alignment of FFA along the fusiform
gyrus.
%
The anterior to posterior variability remains after CBA whilst the medial to
lateral variability has been reduced substantially by macro-anatomical alignment
(Fig. 11).
%
2) another explanation for the remaining variability in the case of FFA may be
that there is not one single area active in the fusiform gyrus when running a
standard FFA localizer and that a different subregion, activated by the FFA
localizing paradigm may be selected as "FFA" in different subjects [cf. Weiner
and Grill-Spector, 2010].
%
This would indicate that the observed variability along the fusiform gyrus
reflects micro-anatomical (i.e.  cytoarchitectonic) differences [Eickhoff et
al., 2005] which are unobservable in vivo.
%
Indeed published probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps show similar variability
in spatial extent and location of micro-anatomically defined areas.

%
In particular the spatial location of "Broca's area" has been shown to be highly
variable [Amunts et al., 2004], even when individual curvature has been taken
into account [Fischl et al., 2008].

%
A similar investigation into the variability of hOc5, thought to be the
micro-anatomically defined area which is functionally known as hMT+, also shows
a similar variability profile as the map of hMT+ in the present study [Malikovic
et al., 2007].

%
By creating probabilistic functional maps using the same subjects for the
investigation of all functional areas, the same scanner and the same analysis
pipeline we have been able to gain important insights into the extent to which
macro-anatomical landmarks are coupled to specific functional areas.

%
A limitation of the current approach is that, due to individual differences in
level of activation, it is impossible to use the same threshold for every
subject.
%
Great care has been taken to individually inspect all functional data and
appropriately select the extent of each and every functional region.
%
It appears however that region selection, as currently implemented, accurately
reflects the underlying functional regions as the results of the gains in
functional overlap are mirrored by the decreases in the distance of peak
vertices to the group average location of an area.
%
Since the latter measure is obtained without subjective choices, it provides
converging evidence that macro-anatomical alignment substantially improves
functional spatial correspondence in many areas.

Other sources of spatial variability may remain in the present probabilistic
maps, one of which may be intra-subject variability.
%
Intra-subject variability is the slight variance in location of activation
observed in one subject, under the same experimental conditions, across separate
scanning sessions.
%
It has been reported that intra-subject variability, as examined by a set of
localizing paradigms of high level visual areas, was on a subvoxel level [Peelen
and Downing, 2005].
%
[Duncan et al. (2009] indicated that the spatial location of functional areas
can vary slightly within the same subject across sessions but notes that
intra-subject variability can be minimized by using relaxed thresholds.
%
We utilized robust localizers of well studied areas and not applying strict
thresholds which should have kept intra-subject variability at a minimum
according to these previous studies.

%
Our results indicate that functional correspondence is substantially improved in
most investigated specialized areas.
%
The application of an advanced surface-based macro-anatomical alignment scheme
substantially increases statistical power beyond what is achievable with
standard affine/piece- wise linear volume normalization techniques.
%
Differences still remain in the location of functional regions after
curvature-based alignment indicating that not all functional areas are tightly
bound to anatomical landmarks (Figs. 5, 8 and 9).


\subsection{Model Space}
%
Results indicate that we are able to use multiple subjects to learn a
10-dimensional shared space for the fMRI data that increases performance on our
experiments.


\subsubsection{Alignment via Movie Runs}

%
15 min of movie watching used for functional alignment outperform prediction
using anatomical alignment;
%
30 minutes of movie watching outperform 15 minutes of movie watching;
%
more than 30 minutes do not lead to a significantly improved prediction
performance.

%
Asymptotic ``performance curve'' might be different for another brain region
(temporal receptive fields?); retinotopic mapping vs. ``higher'' cognition  vs.
executive functions (prefrontal cortex)?


\paragraph{what partial alignment might be good for}
%
Reduced costs.
%
There is a benefit of shared parts of naturalistic stimuli across datasets;
shared stimulus part is easier than shared subjects (e.g.
\citep{zhang2018transfer}).


\subsubsection{Alignment via Audio Runs}


\subsubsection{Alignment via Localizer Runs}

\todo[inline]{cf. general discussion on pro naturalistic stimuli}

\todo[inline]{perform statistical test; which comparisons to test?}

% Cohen 2017
``As a rule of thumb, SRM will improve sensitivity for detecting a cognitive
process of interest in the test data if the training stimuli or trials strongly
and variably engage that process in a way that is reliable across participants''
\citep{cohen2017computational}.

%
``The algorithm also can be applied to simpler, controlled experimental data,
but our previous results showed that the sampling of response vectors from these
experiments is impoverished and produces a model representational space that
does not generalize well to new stimuli in other experiments (Haxby et al.
2011)'' \citep{guntupalli2016model}.
%
``Results show that the computational principles underlying this common
model have broad general validity for representational spaces in occipital,
temporal, parietal, and frontal cortices'' \citep{guntupalli2016model}.

``Hyperalignment of data using a set of stimuli that is less diverse than the
movie is effective, but the resultant common space has validity that is limited
to a small subspace of the representational space in VT cortex''
\citep{haxby2011common}.

%
``Estimating the parameters to transform high-dimensional spaces from individual
brains into a common high-dimensional space requires a rich set of data that
samples a wide variety of cortical patterns in order to generalize to novel
stimuli or tasks.
%
For response hyperalignment, a rich variety of stimuli or conditions are
necessary to sample the response vector space.
%
For connectivity hyperalignment, the sampling of connectivity vector space is
defined by the selection of connectivity targets, but the richness and
reliability of connectivity estimates depends on the variety of brain states
over which connectivity is estimated'' \citep{haxby2020hyperalignment}.


%
``Analogously, the introduction of dynamic videos of faces and control
categories to localize face-selective topographies provides more reliable maps
and better estimate the extent of face-selective regions than do localizers with
still image stimuli [Fox et al., 2009; Pitcher et al., 2011]''
\citep{jiahui2020predicting}.


\paragraph{from project proposal}
%
``While the functional alignment can also be applied to fMRI data from
stimulation paradigms with simplified stimuli, the transformations for
functional alignment have greatly diminished general validity
\citep{haxby2011common}, presumably because such experiments sample a sparser
range of brain states \citep{guntupalli2016model}'' [project proposal].
%
Naturalistic stimuli promise an ``increased validity of derived transformation
for functional alignment by sampling a more diverse set of mental states that
reflect (confound) statistics of the natural environment, and enable
investigation of the acquired data for a variety of research questions (e.g.
visual or auditory perception, spatial cognition; emotion; music, speech or
social perception)'' [project proposal].

%
Moreover, naturalistic stimuli sample a broader range of brain states paradigms
with simplified stimuli \citep{guntupalli2016model, haxby2011common} promising
an increased validity of transformations of functional alignment and increased
generalizability to [research questions/domains/paradigms].



\subsection{Audio PPA}

%
Response in PPA during AO might be different (cf. study in chapter 3).
%
Why do some people do not have a AO PPA? Do simply do not give a shit
about spatial information in AO due to missing task?
%
check: is it different in these persons in AV?


\paragraph{here: data-driven approach; PPA study: model-driven}
%
we might just have modeled the time course of "spatial responses"
insufficiently.
%
Nevertheless, current study is model free, and kind of supports findings that
responses in the PPA are different in the audio-description compared to the
movie.


\subsection{Inter-individual differences / variability}
%
Problem: we have a couple of subjects that seem to simply do not give a fuck
about spatial information in audio-description.


\paragraph{Template from \citet{eickhoff2018imaging}}
%
``divergent patterns of brain organization from the most common pattern (that
is, changes in the spatial arrangement of cortical regions) can be observed in
approximately 5–10\% of the healthy population [16,19], and care should
therefore be taken to avoid the undue influence of such outliers.
%
Notwithstanding their non-conformation to a theoretically universal map of the
brain, such topological outliers, if they do not result from artefacts, can also
be considered to be interesting cases of inter-individual variability to
understand brain–phenotype relationships [98].
%
Indeed, recent studies have suggested that the topography (location and size) of
individual-specific brain parcellations is predictive of individual differences
in demographics, cognition, emotion and personality [3,5,99].
%
Only by understanding the generic characteristic of topographic organization can
we start to appreciate idiosyncrasies and their relationships to
socio-demographic, cognitive or affective profiles''
\citep{eickhoff2018imaging}.


\subsection{Self-critique \& short comings}


\subsubsection{ROI creation procedure}

\todo[inline]{check paper regarding ``probabilistic functional atlases''; these
data are independent but they used masks based on visual inspection and manual
thresholding (mostly), too; and dropped outliers}

%
We have a little leakage of test data.
%
Especially at the borders of the ROI, we miss some voxels (of some participants)
cause the binary masks is based on a ``titrated threshold''
\citep{sengupta2016extension}

%
\paragraph{Template from \citet{weiner2018defining}}

%
``the identification of the PPA is complicated by (at least) four
methodological considerations.
%
First, the PPA definition may depend on the type of experiment, task, and
stimuli used [s. also ``localizer as ground truth below''].
%
Second, the boundaries of the PPA may depend on the statistical threshold used.
%
Third, the spatial extent and localization of the PPA may vary if defined within
the native brain space of an individual or based on a group analysis.
%
Fourth, the size of the PPA may depend on data acquisition choices (e.g. large
vs. small voxels) and data analysis choices (e.g. liberal smoothing vs. no
spatial smoothing).
%
The present study aims to identify and to predict the most probable location of
place-selective voxels within medial VTC of an individual brain that is
impervious to these methodological decisions'' \citep{weiner2018defining}.


\subsubsection{Localizer is ``ground truth''}

\todo[inline]{essentially issues of reliability and validity}


\paragraph{Some templates}
%
``The dynamic localizer (in Grand Budapest data set) was significantly more
reliable than the static localizer (in studyforrest data set) (t(34) = 3.76, p <
0.001) despite its shorter length (four 234s runs versus four 312s runs,
respectively)'' \citep{jiahui2020predicting}.

On reliability of functional localizer runs: ``the tacit assumption is that the
same task in the same subject will identify essentially the same set of voxels
despite various sources of physiological and scanner noise [Aguirre et al.,
1998; Handwerker et al., 2004; Kruger and Glover, 2001]. If there is
considerable variability between runs within the same session, then the basic
idea of functional localization becomes suspect because the localized set of
voxels may not correspond well to those being tested in the main experimental
run, decreasing sensitivity and increasing both false positives and false
negatives'' \citep{duncan2009consistency}.


\subsubsection{Volume-based registration vs. surface-based normalization}

\todo[inline]{could be a nice transition to future questions, because it is just
a minor issue.}

\todo[inline]{we compare volume-based anatomical alignment to volume-based
functional alignment}

%
Sengupta published results of analyses that were compared in voxel space.
%
``Opportunity costs'': I could have run the analyses/contrasts on the surface
but that needs time.
%
Is also a ``problem'' of data sharing: you save time and money (especially if
you do not collect the data yourself) but you have to trust that the data are
``good'' and start at some point to reach goals that you would not accomplished
if you would have done all from scratch (i.e. preprocessing).

%
The \ac{ffa}, and \ac{eba}  which are associated with face perception
\citep{kanwisher1997ffa, pitcher2011occipitalfacearea}, and the perception of
human bodies \citep{downing2001bodyarea}, respectively.


\subsubsection{Sample size}

\todo[inline]{so far, just a plot of one subject shows the correlation of shared

\todo[inline]{can/should that variability somehow be quantified?}

\todo[inline]{of course, replication, bigger sample, and stuff! Which is
transition to ``Future questions''}

%
We change 1/13 of the data for every of the 13 \acp{cfs}.
%
Our model space varies across test subject (s. correlations of shared responses
within the \ac{cfs} suggesting the small sample is causing variable estimates.
%
Hence, of course, future studies, should create a \ac{cfs} based on data from
more subjects.

\paragraph{shared stimulus}

%
A shared stimulus across datasets is easier to employ than letting subjects
participate in different experiments (of different working groups across the
world) \citep[(s.][ for an \ac{srm} based on "shared subjects acrpss

\subsubsection{t-contrasts from other localizers (i.e. brain functions)}

%
What is the limit of what we can estimate reliably?
%
Retinotopy, language, executive functions (from low-level perception to higher
cognition which might not even be sampled by a movie).

%
exogenous vs. endogenous representations; bottom-up vs. top-down processes.


\subsubsection{Other functional alignment algorithms}

\todo[inline]{kind of obvious and a little "for the sake of it"}

\todo[inline]{cf. \citet{bazeille2021empirical} and his dissertation}


\paragraph{Template from \citet{bazeille2021empirical}}
%
``As we use inter-subject decoding to compare functional alignment methods, we
only consider methods that meet the following two criteria.
%
First, the alignment transformations should be learned on activations evoked
during temporally synchronized (i.e., co-occuring) task data, or on contrasts
matched across individuals.
%
Second, the learned transformations must be invertible or almost invertible
linear mappings and applicable as-is on unseen data with a different task
structure.
%
These two criteria exclude several methods currently used in the literature such
as regularized canonical correlation analysis (rCCA; Bilenko and Gallant, 2016),
gradient hyperalignment (Xu et al., 2018), connectivity hyperalignment
(Guntupalli et al., 2018), and methods based on Laplacian embeddings (Langs et
al., 2014)'' \citep{bazeille2021empirical}.

``Nonetheless, it remains unclear how researchers should choose among the
available functional alignment methods for a given research application''
\citep{bazeille2021empirical}.

%
Similarly: influence of voxel count vs. performance (a.k.a. the more training
data, the better; it not just number of participants;
%
In case of search light: how big should it be? PPA seems to vary by centimeters.

% Guntupalli's searchlight
From project proposal: ``\citet{guntupalli2016model} showed that hyperalignment
can be extended to predict functional organization across large proportions of
the cortical surface, for example to predict the represented visual field
coordinate in visual cortex based on retinotopic mapping scans of other
individuals.


\paragraph{Template from \citet{bazeille2021empirical}}
%
``To align the entire cortex across subjects, two main frameworks have been
proposed: searchlight and piecewise aggregation schemes.
%
Each of these frameworks use functional alignment methods to learn local
transformations and aggregate them into a single large-scale alignment;
%
however, searchlight and piecewise differ in how they aggregate transforms, as
illustrated in Figure 2.
%
The searchlight scheme [Kriegeskorte et al., 2006], popular in brain imaging
[Guntupalli et al., 2018; 2016], has been used as a way to divide the cortex
into small overlapping spheres of a field radius.
%
This method allows researchers to remain agnostic as to the location of
functional or anatomical boundaries, such as those suggested by
parcellation-based approaches.
%
A local transform can then be learned in each sphere and the full alignment is
obtained by aggregating [e.g. summing as in Guntupalli et al., 2016 or
averaging] across overlapping transforms.
%
Importantly, the aggregated transformation produced is no longer guaranteed to
bear the type of regularity (e.g orthogonality, isometry, or diffeomorphicity
enforced during the local neighborhood fit'' \citep{bazeille2021empirical}.

%
``As piecewise alignment is learned within a parcellation, an important question
is:
%
which brain atlas should be used for piecewise alignment? In Supplementary
Figure S2 we compare results from the Schaefer et al. (2018) atlases to those
from parcellations derived directly on the alignment data.
%
By default, the results presented below are derived with the 300 ROI
parcellation of the Schaefer atlas unless noted otherwise.
%
In the case of searchlight Procrustes, we selected searchlight parameters to
match those used in Guntupalli et al. (2016);
%
that is, each searchlight had 5 voxel radius, with a 3 voxel distance between
searchlight centers'' \citep{bazeille2021empirical}.

``An alternative scheme, piecewise alignment [Bazeille et al., 2019], uses
non-overlapping neighborhoods either learned from the data using a parcellation
method—such as k-means—or derived from an a priori functional or anatomical
atlas.
%
Local transforms are derived in each neighborhood and concatenated to yield a
single large-scale transformation.
%
Unlike searchlight, this returns a transformation matrix with the desired
regularities.
%
This framework might induce staircase effects or other functionally-irrelevant
discontinuities in the final transformation due to the underlying boundaries.''

%
``Falko Kaule showed that congruent time-locked BOLD responses across subjects
(i.e. all subjects watching the exact same full-length movie) as used by Haxby
and colleagues are not required to derive a valid alignment of individuals with
a common representational space \citep{kaule2017examination}.
%
Comparable prediction performance can be achieved by using functional
connectivity patterns (correlation of a voxel's time series with reference
regions in the same brain).
%
The number of voxels that can be considered simultaneously for functional BOLD
response time series alignment is limited by the number of timepoints in the
calibration scan (about 300-400 voxels for a 15min scan with a 2s TR,
corresponding to a local cortical neighborhood of about 1cm in diameter for a
standard resolution).
%
This limitation does not exist in this form for a functional alignment that is
based on connectivity vectors.
%
The length of these connectivity vectors is determined by the number of
reference (or seed) regions in the brain'' [from project proposal].


\paragraph{other templates}
%
``Results showed that both CHA and RHA increased ISCs and bsMVPC classification
accuracies significantly over anatomy-based alignment, but each algorithm
achieves better alignment for the information that it uses to derive a common
model, namely connectivity profiles and patterns of response, respectively''
\citep{guntupalli2018computational}.

%
``Hyperalignment projects cortical pattern vectors into a common,
high-dimensional information space [Haxby et al., 2020].
%
Derivation of this common space can be based on either neural response profiles
(e.g. data collected during tasks, such as movie viewing (Haxby et al., 2011))
or functional connectivity profiles files [Guntupalli et al., 2018]''

response time series circumvents the need for a single shared stimulus across

``The flip side of focusing on shared responses is to focus on responses that
are idiosyncratic to individuals.
%
Although these responses are excluded in SRM, they are not necessarily noise and

SRM can be used to isolate participant-unique responses by examining the
residuals after removing shared group responses, or it can be applied
hierarchically to the residuals to identify subgroups [\citet{chen2017shared};
this is another "Chen"?!].

Recognizing that signal exists beyond the average or shared response of a group,
such studies exploit idiosyncratic but stable responses to account for
previously unexplained variance in brain function, behavioral performance and
