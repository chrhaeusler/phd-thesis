\section{Abstract}
% intro
\textit{Intro:} In order to map perceptual or cognitive functions onto the brain
anatomy of study participants, researchers usually conduct dedicated experiments
\textit{functional localizers} often accompanied with a task.

% problem
\textit{Current approach \& problem:} Nevertheless, the approach ``one paradigm
to map one domain of brain functions'' becomes impractical if a variety of
domains is supposed to be mapped in a time-efficient manner.

% therefore
\textit{Therefore:} In the current study, we explore a way and quantity of data
needed to (reliably) predict individual and idiosyncratic functional
topographies by projecting results of a localizer experiment (statistical
$Z$-maps) from a reference group into the brain anatomy of individual
participants.

\textit{Method:}
% data
During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), participants ($N=14$) took
part in a task-based, block-design visual localizer and two naturalistic stimuli
paradigms: an audio-visual movie and the movie's audio-description, both
paradigms free of any task.
% cms creation
Based on these response time-series, we first created a common model space
employing a shared response model \citep{chen2015reduced} following a $N-1$ fold
procedure [correct term??], a process that also computed transformation matrices
for the subjects that provided the data for the creation of the model space.
% alignment
Then, we aligned left-out subjects with the common [via Procusted
transformation?] to derive transformation matrices for the left-out-subjects by
also varying the quantity of functional response time-series to perform the
alignment.
% prediction
Lastly, the acquired transformation matrices were used to project the functional
topographies from the anatomy of the reference group into the common model
space, and from the common model space into the anatomy of the left-out
subjects.
% stimulus length?
[We assessed the relationship between length of naturalistic stimulation used
for a \textit{partial functional alignment} and the performance of predicting
empirical $Z$-maps.]
%
\textit{Results} suggest that ``a subject's idiosyncratic functional topography
can be estimated with high fidelity from that subject's fMRI data obtained while
watching a naturalistic movie using hyperalignment to project other subjects’
localizer data into that subject's idiosyncratic cortical anatomy''
\citep{jiahui2020predicting}.

%
\textit{Discussion}: stimulus length: 15-30 min vs. 2h;  results of auditory stimulus to predict visual localizer are ``modest''.

%
\textit{Conclusion}: ``These findings lay the foundation for developing an
efficient tool for mapping functional topographies for a wide range of
perceptual and cognitive functions in new subjects based only on fMRI data
collected while watching an engaging, naturalistic stimulus and other subjects'
localizer data from a normative sample'' \citep{jiahui2020predicting}.


\section{Introduction}

\todo[inline]{mih: Dieses Kapitel sollte konzeptuell und inhaltlich deutlich als
"und jetzt alles zusammen" erscheinen}

PPA" kind of localized in PPA-Paper}

\todo[inline]{define PPA in intro shortly (maybe \ac{ffa}, too)}
\todo[inline]{cf. PPA paper}
\todo[inline]{Definition of functional topography, functional anatomy}

% brain mapping
Topographic brain mapping maps brain functions, perceptual or cognitive
processes, onto anatomical brain areas (\textit{functional areas}).

\todo[inline]{examples like PPA etc.}
%
``The topographies of category-selective areas are mostly distributed similarly
across individuals, but great individual variability exists in the locus, the
size, and the shape of the category-selective areas [Zhen et al., 2015, 2017]''
\citep{jiahui2020predicting}.

% localizer
Traditionally, location, size, and shape of functional areas are determined by
letting study participants perform a task during a \textit{functional localizer}
paradigm.
%
``To deal with the idiosyncratic topography of functional areas,
category-selective areas are identified separately in each individual using a
``functional localizer'' fMRI scan'' \citep{jiahui2020predicting}.
%
``Functional localizers use a simple contrast between responses to different
categories of stimuli, such as responses to faces versus responses to objects,
to identify category-selective areas or to map a category-selectivity topography
[Saxe et al., 2006]'' \citep{jiahui2020predicting}.


\subsection{The problem}

% problem: one localizer for one domain
Functional localizers are designed to maximize detection power and thus
dedicated to map just one domain of brain functions (e.g. different object
categories; \citet{kanwisher1997ffa}) or cognitive processes (e.g. theory of
mind; \citet{spunt2014validating}) and
% which gets messy
Consequently, if a researcher or practitioner wants to map a variety of domains,
the approach ``one paradigm in order to map one domain of functions'' gets
time-consuming and inefficient.

% localizer batteries: intro
Researchers have tried to tackle this issue by creating time-efficient
multi-functional \textit{localizer batteries} \citep{barch2013function,
drobyshevsky2006rapid, pinel2007fast}.
% localizer batteries: example
For example, \citet{pinel2007fast} employs a range of dedicated stimuli and
specific tasks in a 5-minute routine to map processes of ``auditory and visual
perception, motor actions, reading, language comprehension, and mental
calculation at an individual level'' \citet{pinel2007fast}.
% task based = shit
Nevertheless, the diagnostic quality of localizer batteries relies heavily on
the participant's comprehension of the task instruction and general compliance,
a criterion that can be difficult to meet in clinical or pediatric populations.

\todo[inline]{better delete the following: why predict results of unecological
paradigm at all? Discuss localizer=``ground truth'' in discussion}

% localizer: validity
Further, localizer batteries rely on carefully chosen and tightly-controlled,
simplified stimuli.
%
Given that these simplified stimuli are presented in blocks of stimuli, often
accompanied with a task to keep participants alert and attentive, localizer
paradigms to not resemble how we perceive the real-world during every-day life
leading to questionable external and ecologically validity.\todo{add references}


\subsection{The solution: predict from reference data}

An alternative approach to submit a person or patient to a \ac{fmri} scanning
procedure is to predict a person's functional topography based on data collected
in a reference group. Predictions can be performed based on \textit{anatomical
alignment} or \textit{functional alignment}


\subsubsection{Anatomical alignment}

\todo[inline]{btw: there is ``real'' prediction from anatomy (e.g.  cortical
folding) not using anatomical template to project data into/out of}

% \citep{weiner2018defining} compares cortex-based alignment
% \citep{fischl1999high} with volume-based (Talairach) alignment: ``we repeated
% our leave-one-out cross-validation procedure across all 24 participants with
% an affine volume-based registration to the Talairach brain and compared this
% performance to the same procedure implemented with CBA in FreeSurfer
% \citep{weiner2018defining}''

Aligns to a ``common cortical topography''

% current approach
Anatomical alignment (AA) predicts functional topographies based on the
anatomical location, size, and shape of a functional area in the anatomy
reference group (e.g. \citet{weiner2018defining})
% volume based
Volume-based anatomical alignment \citep{evans19933d} aligns voxel-wise data of
individual subjects to a three-dimensional brain template [e.g. MNI152 template;
QUOTE].
% surface-based
Surface-based anatomical alignment \citep{fischl1999cortical}  aligns
vertex-wise data of individual subjects to a two-dimensional template (e.g.
FreeSurfer fsaverage template; \citep{fischl1999high}).
%
The most probable functional topography of a new subject is predicted by
projecting averaged functional data of the reference group through the brain
template into the new subject's subject-specific anatomy.

``Anatomical alignment methods aim at solving the anatomical structure problem
us- ing specific anatomical features for alignment [1, 2, 3]. Yet, they fail to
align functional topographies satisfactorily [2, 4]'' \citep{turek2017semi}.

``More recently, methods that align functional topographies have emerged. These
methods leverage the smoothness prop- erties of fMRI data [5, 6] to extract
shared aspects across subjects using factor models. Techniques based on
Principal Component Analysis [7], Independent Component Analy- sis [8],
Dictionary Learning [9], and Canonical Correlation Analysis [10] have been
proposed. Another example is the Hyperalignment method [11] that assumes that
subjects were presented with a time-synchronized stimulus and extracts shared
features across subjects with orthogonal projections. The Shared Response Model
(SRM) [12] follows a similar idea but boosts the predictive power of the
subsequent analysis methods'' \citep{turek2017semi}.

`FFunctional alignment methods are typically unsupervised and fail to use these
training labels to learn the shared characteristics of the multi-subject data''
\citep{turek2017semi}.

\paragraph{Functional-anatomical correspondence}

\todo[inline]{shorten and rephrase}
%
Nevertheless, one of ``one of the main obstacles in leveraging brain activity
across subjects is the considerable heterogeneity of functional topographies
from individual to individual. Variability in functional--anatomical
correspondence across individuals means that even high-performing anatomical
alignment does not ensure fine-grained functional alignment [e.g.,
\citet{frost2012measuring}]'' \citep{kumar2020brainiak}.
%
``Fine-grained functional organization of cortex is not well-conserved across
individuals. As a result, individual differences in cortical functional
architecture are confounded by topographic idiosyncrasies--i.e., differences in
functional–anatomical correspondence'' \citep{feilong2018reliable}.

``Functional architecture of the human brain is relatively consistent across
individuals at a coarse scale, but idiosyncrasies in functional topography
become increasingly apparent at finer scales. []. At the areal level,
category-selective regions can be localized to anatomical landmarks [Weiner et
al., 2018, 2014], though the locus can differ across individuals by millimeters
or centimeters, along with variability in size and shape [Zhen et al., 2017,
2015]. Furthermore, within a brain area, between-subject classification of
response patterns is typically considerably worse than within-subject
classification [e.g., Cox and Savoy, 2003; Haxby et al., 2011], indicating that
fine-grained functional architecture is not well-aligned macroanatomically. With
state-of-the-art cortical surface-based alignment [Fischl, 2012], the mismatch
between brain function and anatomy can be reduced but not eliminated [Duncan et
al., 2009; Frost and Goebel, 2012; Weiner et al., 2018]. Therefore, it is
problematic to assume that a given anatomical location or topographic
conformation will have the same functional role across brains''
\citep{feilong2018reliable}.


\subsubsection{Functional alignment (FA)}

\todo[inline]{shorten and rephrase}
\todo[inline]{terms ``\ac{cms}'' and ``shared feature space'' are still kind of
used interchangeably}

% definition
Functional alignment is a recently developed alternative to anatomical alignment
and promises to preserve more fine-grained idiosyncrasies across individuals.
%
``Functional alignment algorithms that are based on common temporal response
profiles such as Hyperalignment [Haxby, 2011; Guntupalli, 2016] and the Shared
Response Model (SRM) [Chen, 2016] ``attempt to remap regions across participants
and can be highly effective at improving spatial alignment across people based
on common functional responses while still maintaining individual differences
[\citep{feilong2018reliable}]'' \citep{chang2021endogenous}.
%
Functional alignment algorithms align cortical anatomy of different subjects
based on the maximization of the inter-subject similarity of \ac{bold} responses
\citep{haxby2011common, chen2015reduced, sabuncu2010function} correlating with a
time-locked external stimulation (e.g. movie or auditory narrative), or
connectivity profiles \citep{feilong2018reliable, guntupalli2018computational}.

%
``Hyperalignment [Guntupalli et al., 2016, 2018; Haxby et al., 2011] is a family
of methods that can disentangle functional variability from anatomical
variability. Hyperalignment projects features (voxels or surface vertices) from
a brain into a common high-dimensional space through linear transformations. In
this common space, the same features from different individuals will share
similar functional properties instead of the same anatomical locations or
topographic conformations. Hyperalignment decomposes the original fMRI data of
each individual into two parts: a transformation matrix, which reflects
topographic properties of the individual's functional activations; and a new
data matrix in the common space, which reflects shared, stimulus-driven
responses. This hyperaligned data matrix provides an opportunity to study brain
functions without confounds from topographic variability''
\citep{feilong2018reliable}.

%
``The dimensions of this common model capture functional profiles that are
shared across individuals such as cortical response profiles collected during a
common time-locked stimulus presentation (e.g. movie viewing) or functional
connectivity profiles'' \citep{busch2021hybrid}.

%
``Hyperalignment derives individual transformation matrices to project
information encoded in idiosyncratic topographies into a common model
information space. These matrices are derived based either on responses to a
naturalistic stimulus, such as a movie, or on functional connectivity
\citep{guntupalli2018computational}'' \citep{jiahui2020predicting}.

%
``Hyperalignment models shared information that is embedded in idiosyncratic
cortical patterns across brains. Modeling shared information makes it possible
to compare functional anatomy across brains at a fine spatial scale.
Hyperalignment projects cortical pattern vectors into a common, high-dimensional
information space [Haxby et al., 2020]. Derivation of this common space can be
based on either neural response profiles (e.g. data collected during tasks, such
as movie viewing (Haxby et al., 2011)) or functional connectivity profiles files
[Guntupalli et al., 2018]'' \citep{busch2021hybrid}.

%
``A major objective of the hyperalignment algorithm is to map the shared
information originally found in idiosyncratic cortical topographies into a
common space in which this information is better aligned across participants''
\citep{busch2021hybrid}.


\subsubsection{Prediction using hyperalignment}

%
An alternative approach, to individual localization has been proposed by
\citet{haxby2011common}.
%
They (and e.g. \citet{jiahui2020predicting}) also predicted the location, form,
and size of target brain areas in medial ventral temporal cortex from dedicated
localizer scans of other individuals.
%
The key difference of this approach is to rely on similarity of representational
geometry of brain activity patterns and aligning individual brains into a
multi-dimensional functional group space, termed \ac{cms}.

%
For example, \citet{haxby2011common, guntupalli2016model} have shown that
``idiosyncratic topographies for category-selectivity and retinotopy can be
estimated in individual brains with high fidelity using hyperalignment to
project other subjects' functional localizer data into a target subject's
ventral temporal and occipital cortical anatomy'' \citep{jiahui2020predicting}.
%
``Our findings show that individually-tailored maps estimated from other
subjects’ data after hyperalignment correlate much more highly with maps
estimated from that subject's own localizer data than does a group average map
based on anatomical normalization'' \citep{jiahui2020predicting}.
%
Hyperalignment, an algorithm that was pioneered by \citet{haxby2011common}, uses
\ac{bold} response patterns to derive a \ac{cms} using a variant of Procrustes
analysis and computes invertible (orthonormal) transformations from each
individual brain's voxel-space into the \ac{cms}.
%
Importantly, the study also showed that an individual's \ac{ffa} or the
\ac{ppa}, can be localized precisely based on data from a reference group.


\subsubsection{Shared response model}

\paragraph{Definition of SRM}

``Another recent paper \citep{chen2015reduced} introduced the \ac{srm}, an algorithm that stems from previous work on hyperalignment
\citep{haxby2011common}'' \citep{vodrahalli2018mapping}.

``\ac{srm} \citep{chen2015reduced} is an unsupervised probabilistic latent
variable model for multi-subject fMRI data under a time-synchronized stimulus``
\citep{vodrahalli2018mapping}.

%
``SRM offers jointly factoring each participant's data into a shared set of
feature time series and subject-specific topographies for each feature ''
\citep{cohen2017computational}.
%
``The \ac{srm} \citep{chen2015reduced} projects \ac{fmri} responses from
each participant into a low-dimensional space that captures temporal variance
shared across participants'' \citep{cohen2017computational}.

%
``SRM estimation is driven by the commonality in functional responses induced by
a shared stimulus . Unlike ISC analysis, which presupposes (often very coarse)
functional correspondence, SRM isolates the shared response while accommodating
misalignment across subjects'' \citep{kumar2020brainiak}.

%
``The algorithm learns a separate transformation matrix that projects each
participant into this common space \citep{chen2015reduced}. Estimating a
lower-dimensional common model space can potentially aid in filtering out
measurement noise that is assumed to be independent across individuals''
\citep{chang2021endogenous}'s method section.
%


\paragraph{What does SRM do}
%
``SRM decomposes multi-subject fMRI data into a lower-dimensional shared space
and subject-specific transformation matrices for projecting from each subject's
idiosyncratic voxel space into the shared space (Figure 2). Each of these
topographic transformations effectively rotates and reduces each subject's voxel
space to find a subspace of shared features where the multivariate trajectory of
responses to the stimulus is best aligned. These shared features do not
correspond to individual voxels; rather, they are distributed across the full
voxel space of each subject; each shared feature can be understood as a weighted
sum of many voxels'' \citep{kumar2020brainiak}.


%
``fMRI data are collected from each of m participants experiencing the same
stimulus and then organized into a matrix X (voxels by time). Each matrix X is
then factored using a probabilistic latent-factor model into the product of a
subject-specific matrix W of k brain maps (an orthogonal basis) and a shared
temporal response matrix S of size k by time. That is, for each participant: X =
W S + R, where X, W, and the residuals, R (not shown), are subject-specific, and
S is shared across participant's'' [text of Figure 4 in]
\citep{cohen2017computational}.

%
``The SRM in \citet{chen2015reduced} optimizes the objective
$\sum_{i=1}^{n}||X_{i}-W_{i}S||_{F}$ for a low-dimensional shared space S and
orthogonal-column subject specific maps $W_{i}$, and can be thought of as a
multi-subject extension of PCA.  Simultaneously reducing dimensionality across
subjects outperforms other averaging approaches at matching up specific
timepoints in a movie across subjects'' \citep{vodrahalli2018mapping}'s Intro
section.

``Specifically, SRM learns $N$ maps $W_{i}$ with orthogonal columns such that
$||X_{i}-W_{i}S||_{F}$ is minimized over $\left\{ W_{i}\right\} _{i=1}^{N},S$,
where $X_{i}\in\mathbb{R}^{v\times{T}}$ is the $i^{th}$ subject's fMRI response
($v$ voxels by $T$ repetition times) and $S\in\mathbb{R}^{k\times{T}}$ is a
feature time-series in a $k$-dimensional shared space. In this paper, $k=10$
since low-rank SVD [Singular Value Decomposition?] with 20 dimensions captures
90\% of the variance of the original fMRI matrices \citep{chen2015reduced}. We
also experimented with using $k=5,20,30,40,50$, but the results barely varied
from using $k=10$ dimensions.  Note that, for testing, the learned $W_{i}$ allow
us to project unseen fMRI data into the shared space via $W_{i}^{T}X_{i}^{test}$
since $W_{i}$ has orthogonal columns'' \citep{vodrahalli2018mapping}'s method
section.

%
``Figure 2: The SRM is estimated from response time-series from the training set
for multiple subjects. The multi-subject response time series are decomposed
into a set of subject-specific orthogonal topographic transformation matrices
and a reduced-dimension shared response space. The learned subject-specific
topographic bases can be used to project test data into the shared space. This
projection functionally aligns the test data'' \citep{kumar2020brainiak}.

%
``Transformations estimated from one subset of data can be used to project
unseen data into the shared space. Projecting data into shared space increases
both temporal and spatial ISC (by design), and in many cases improves
between-subject model performance to the level of within-subject performance''
\citep{kumar2020brainiak}.
%
``Between-subject models with SRM can, in some cases, exceed the performance of
within-subject models because (a) the reduced-dimension shared space can
highlight stimulus-related variance by filtering out noisy or
non-stimulus-related features, and (b) the between-subject model can effectively
leverage a larger volume of data after functional alignment than is available
for any single subject'' \citep{kumar2020brainiak}.
%
``De-noised individual-subject data can be reconstructed by projecting data from
the reduced-dimension shared space back into any given subject’s brain space''
\citep{kumar2020brainiak}.
%
``Furthermore, in cases where each subject's unique response is of more interest
than the shared signal, SRM can be used to factor out the shared component
thereby isolating the idiosyncratic response for each subject [13]''
\citep{kumar2020brainiak}.

In SRM, the brain data for each participant $i$ are represented as an $n$ voxel
by $t$ time matrix  $X_{i}$. A pre-specified number of features are used to
learn a $k$ feature by  $t$ time shared space $S$ and a participant-specific $n$
voxel by $k$  feature matrix $W_{i}$. This weight matrix, reflecting the loading
of voxels onto features, is randomly initialized then fit over iterations to
minimize the error in explaining participant data. At the same time, the time
course of the features in the shared space is learned.



\paragraph{how we use it: for functional alignment}

``What is reliable across different participants when performing the same task,
for example watching a movie? In previous notebooks, inter-subject correlation
and inter-subject functional correlation revealed similarity in patterns of
brain activity across participants. We can exploit this similarity to find a
lower-dimensional shared space that retains features of the data that are common
across participants. The shared response model (SRM) aims to learn this shared
feature space and how to map individual participant data into it (Chen et al.,
2015). SRM can be used as a functional alignment technique: once fit, other data
from the same participants can be transformed into the shared space with these
mappings, to be used as input for other analyses'' (SRM-Tutorial).


\subsubsection{Functional alignment works better with naturalistic stimuli}

\todo[inline]{fit shortened version of following text into text about functional
alignment algorithm that uses response-profiles as input}

%
Increased validity of derived transformation for functional alignment by
sampling a more diverse set of mental states that reflect (confound) statistics
of the natural environment, and enable investigation of the acquired data for a
variety of research questions (e.g. visual or auditory perception, spatial
cognition; emotion; music, speech or social perception)

``Naturalistic stimuli such as movies and stories are often used to generate
such training data, though any study design in which participants perform the
same sequence of trials --- or for which a common sequence can be spliced
together from the same set of trials --- could be used (for example, a battery
of cognitive tasks)'' \citep{cohen2017computational}
%
``As a rule of thumb, SRM will improve sensitivity for detecting a cognitive
process of interest in the test data if the training stimuli or trials strongly
and variably engage that process in a way that is reliable across participants''
\citep{cohen2017computational}.

%
``There are many potential advantages to using data collected during
movie-viewing for estimating category-selective topographies. Movies are more
engaging and result in better compliance \citep{vanderwal2015inscapes}. Movie
viewing can also be used in subject populations, such as children
\citep{richardson2018development} or patients, that may have trouble maintaining
attention during repetitions of a tedious localizer task''
\citep{jiahui2020predicting}.
%
``Movies engage multiple brain systems in parallel. From a single movie dataset
multiple functional topographies can be estimated [Guntupalli et al., 2016],
whereas different localizers are typically required to map different functional
topographies, making a thorough mapping of selective topographies time-consuming
and inefficient'' \citep{jiahui2020predicting}.
%
``Movies also simulate better the statistics of natural viewing and listening
and may provide more ecologically valid maps. Analogously, the introduction of
dynamic videos of faces and control categories to localize face-selective
topographies provides more reliable maps and better estimate the extent of
face-selective regions than do localizers with still image stimuli (Fox et al.,
2009; Pitcher et al., 2011)'' \citep{jiahui2020predicting}.
%
``Similarly, naturalistic stimuli may better sample the full range of responses
to faces and other stimuli that contribute to face-selective topographies''
\citep{jiahui2020predicting}.

``Even within a sensory modality, such as vision, different types of information
are layered and simultaneously present in natural movies. The rich, layered
information in movies has allowed concurrent modeling of multiple stages of
perceptual processing (Nishimoto et al., 2011; Huth et al., 2012; Güclü and van
Gerven, 2017). Broader sampling and efficient engagement of multiple systems
motivated the use of movie-viewing data as the basis for developing algorithms
for aligning functional anatomy (Conroy et al., 2009, 2013; Sabuncu et al.,
2010; Haxby et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2015; Guntupalli et al., 2016, 2018)''
\citep{haxby2020naturalistic}.

%
While the functional alignment can also be applied to fMRI data from stimulation
paradigms with simplified stimuli, the transformations for functional alignment
have greatly diminished general validity \citep{haxby2011common}, presumably
because such experiments sample a sparser range of brain states
\citep{guntupalli2016model}.


\subsection{Aim \& summary of methods (a.k.a. "Here, we...")}

From \citet{jiahui2020predicting}: ``Here, we show that precise mapping of
functional topographies in a new subject can be achieved using hyperalignment
and a database of movie and localizer data from other subjects.
%
We present a proof-of-concept analysis of two different data sets with different
movies and different face-selectivity localizers.
%
We used hyperalignment to projects all other subjects' data into a group common
information space and then projecting data from the common space into a new
subject's cortical anatomy'' \citep{jiahui2020predicting}.


% main idea
Here, we predict location, size, and shape of a functional area in an individual
person based on location, size, and shape of the same functional area in persons
of a reference group.

\subsection{Hypotheses}
%
functional alignment outperforms anatomical alignment.
%
The more data for alignment the better.
%
for discussion: asymptotic curve might be different for another brain region
(we look at perception; what about ``higher'' cognition or even executive
functions?)


\subsection{Summary of results}
%
``Results expands previous analysis from ventral temporal cortex to the whole
cortex, showing strong correlations of face-selectivity topographic maps derived
from a subject's own localizer data with maps derived from other subjects'
localizer data projected into that subject's cortical anatomy. Both the two-step
algorithm and the new one-step algorithm, which we introduce here, produce
high-fidelity, individualized topographic maps, but the new one-step algorithm
maps were superior'' \citep{jiahui2020predicting}.


\subsection{What it will be good for}

\todo[inline]{one or two sentences should be enough in the intro, talk about it
in discussion and general discussion}
%
``results lay a foundation for building a computational tool with a
database that could allow others to map multiple functional topographies in new
subjects using only data collected during movie viewing. Functional localizers
are inefficient because they only estimate one or a few topographies for each
localizer. Movies, by contrast, engage in parallel multiple neural systems for
vision, audition, language, person perception, social cognition, and other
functions. Consequently, movies have the potential to estimate selective
topographies in all of these domains. Such a tool would require a database of
data for movies and a range of functional localizers in a normative group of
subjects. A new subject's functional topographies could be estimated based only
on that subject's movie data and other subjects’ localizer data from the
normative database that could be projected into that subject’s cortical anatomy
using hyperalignment transformation matrices derived from movie data. Such a
resource would be more efficient and replace tedious functional localizers with
an engaging movie and could enable mapping of multiple functional topographies
with data from a single fMRI using a naturalistic stimulus''

% input data
We spliced the data together: ``Naturalistic stimuli such as movies and stories
are often used to generate such training data, though any study design in which
participants perform the same sequence of trials—or for which a common sequence
can be spliced together from the same set of trials—could be used (for example,
a battery of cognitive tasks)'' \citep{cohen2017computational}

% reference to PPA-Paper
As in study 2, we
%
used components of the publicly available
\href{http://www.studyforrest.org}{studyforrest.org} dataset that has been
repeatedly used by other research groups in independent studies
(\citep[e.g.,][]{ben2018hippocampal, jiahui2020predicting, hu2017decoding,
lettieri2019emotionotopy, nguyen2016integration}).

% see corresponding papers for details
An exhaustive description of the participants, stimulus creation, procedure,
stimulation setup, and fMRI acquisition can be found in the corresponding
publications. Following is a summary of the most important aspects.


\subsection{Participants}

\todo[inline]{following phrasing is almost identical to study2}
% VIS study
In the block-design localizer study \citep{sengupta2016extension}, 15
participants took part in a six-category block-design visual localizer.
% AV study
In the movie study \citep{hanke2016simultaneous}, the same 15 participants
(21–39 years, mean age 29.4, six female), watched the audio-visual movie
``Forrest Gump'' \citep{ForrestGumpMovie} with dubbed German audio track
\citep{ForrestGumpDVD}.
% AD study
In the audio-description study \citep{hanke2014audiomovie}, 20 German native
speakers (all right-handed, age 21–38 years, mean age 26.6 years, 12 male), of
whom 15 participants also took part in the localizer and movie study, listened
to the German audio-description \citep{ForrestGumpGermanAD} of the movie.
% participants' health
All participants reported to have normal hearing, normal or corrected-to-normal
vision, and no known history of neurological disorders.
% compensation, consent and shit
In all studies, participants received monetary compensation and gave written
informed consent for their participation and for public sharing of obtained data
in anonymized form. The studies had prior approval by the Ethics Committee of
Otto-von-Guericke University of Magdeburg, Germany.


\subsection{Stimuli and procedure}

\todo[inline]{following phrasing is almost identical to PPA-Paper}

\subsubsection{Functional localizer}

% VIS study picture categories
Stimuli for the block-design localizer study were 24 unique grayscale images of
faces, bodies, objects, houses, outdoor scenes and scrambled images, matched in
luminance and size, that were previously used in other studies
\citep[e.g.,][]{haxby2011common}.
% procedure: presentation & instructions
Participants performed a one-back image matching task for four block-design
runs, with two \unit[16]{s} blocks per stimulus category in each run.
%
For details on stimulus creation and presentation see
\citet{sengupta2016extension}.


\subsubsection{Naturalistic stimuli}
% AD & AV stimulus name & references
The German DVD release \citep{ForrestGumpDVD} of the movie ``Forrest Gump''
\citep{ForrestGumpMovie} and its temporally aligned audio-description
\citep{ForrestGumpGermanAD} served as naturalistic stimuli, with an approximate
duration of two hours, split into eight consecutive segments of
\unit[$\approx$15]{minutes}.
% AD: additional narrator
The audio-description adds another male narrator to the voice-over narration of
the main character Forrest Gump. This additional narration describes essential
aspects of the visual scenery when there is no off-screen voice, dialog, or
other relevant auditory content.
% task
For all sessions with naturalistic stimuli, participants were instructed to
inhibit physical movements except for eye-movements, and otherwise to simply
``enjoy the presentation''.
%
For details on stimulus creation and presentation see
\citet{hanke2014audiomovie, hanke2016simultaneous}.


\subsection{Stimulation setup}

\todo[inline]{following phrasing is almost identical to PPA-Paper}

% instructions and distance; screen size \unit[23.75 $\times$ 10.25]{cm}
In the block-design localizer, movie study, and audio-description study, visual
instructions were presented on a rear-projection screen inside the scanner bore
at a viewing distance of \unit[63]{cm}.
%
Stimulus images of the localizer paradigm were displayed at a size of
approximately \unit[10]$^{\circ}$ $\times$ \unit[10]$^{\circ}$ of visual angle.
%
Movie frames of the movie paradigm were displayed at a size of approximately
\unit[21.3]$^{\circ}$ $\times$ \unit[9.3]$^{\circ}$.
% AD
During the functional scans of the audio-description study, the projector
presented a medium gray screen with the primary purpose to illuminate a
participant's visual field in order to prevent premature fatigue.
% AD & AV: auditory stimulation
Auditory stimulation was implemented using custom in-ear (audio-description), or
over-the-ear headphones (movie), which reduced the scanner noise by at least
\unit[20–30]{dB}.


\subsection{fMRI data acquisition}
%
\todo[inline]{following phrasing is almost identical to PPA-Paper}
% AV & VIS
In the block-design localizer and the movie study, a \unit[3]{Tesla} Philips
Achieva dStream MRI scanner with a 32 channel head coil acquired gradient-echo
fMRI data at \unit[2]{s} repetition time with
% slices
35 axial slices (thickness \unit[3.0]{mm}, \unit[10]{\%} inter-slice gap) with
\unit[80 $\times$ 80]{voxels} (\unit[3.0 $\times$ 3.0]{mm} of in-plane
resolution, \unit[240]{mm} field-of-view) and an anterior-to-posterior phase
encoding direction, recorded in ascending order.
% visual localizer: 4 x 156 TR
A total of 624 volumes were recorded for each participant across the four runs
of the visual localizer experiment.
%
A total 3599 volumes were recorded for each participant across the eight runs of
the movie study.

% AD
In the audio-description study gradient-echo fMRI data were acquired using a
\unit[7]{Tesla} Siemens MAGNETOM magnetic resonance scanner equipped with a 32
channel brain receive coil at \unit[2]{s} repetition time (TR) with 36 axial
slices (thickness \unit[1.4]{mm}, \unit[1.4 $\times$ 1.4]{mm} in-plane
resolution, \unit[224]{mm} field-of-view, anterior-to-posterior phase encoding
direction) and a \unit[10]{\%} inter-slice gap, recorded in ascending order.
% slice orientation
Slices were oriented to include the ventral portions of frontal and occipital
cortex while minimizing intersection with the eyeballs.
% FOV
The field of view was centered on the approximate location of Heschl's gyrus.
% motion correction
EPI images were online-corrected for motion and geometric distortions.
%
An number of 3599 volumes, identical to the movies study, was recorded for each
participant in the audio-description study.

%
High-resolution T1-weighted structural images with 274 sagittal slices (FoV
191.8 $\times$ 256 $\times$ \unit[256]{mm}) and an acquisition voxel size of
\unit[0.7]{mm} with a 384 $\times$ 384 in-plane reconstruction matrix
(\unit[0.67]{mm} isotropic resolution) were recorded using a 3D turbo field echo
(TFE) sequence (TR = \unit[2500]{ms}, TE = \unit[5.7]{ms}, TI = \unit[900]{ms},
flip angle = 8 $^{\circ}$, bandwidth 144.4 Hz/px, Sense reduction AP 1.2, RL
2.0.

\subsection{Preprocessing}

\todo[inline]{following phrasing is almost identical to PPA-Paper}

% data sources
The current analyses were carried out on the same preprocessed fMRI data
\citep{hanke2016aligned} that were used for the technical validation analysis
presented in \citet{hanke2016simultaneous}, the localization of higher-visual
areas \citep{sengupta2016extension}, and investigation of responses of the PPA
correlating with naturalistic spatial information \citep{sengupta2016extension}.
% exclusion of VP 10
Of those 15 participants in the studyforrest dataset that took part in all three
experiments, data of one participant were dropped due to invalid distortion
correction during scanning of the audio-description stimulus.
% preprocessing of pre-aligned data
Data were corrected for motion, aligned with and re-sliced onto a
participant-specific BOLD template image \citep{sengupta2016extension} (uniform
spatial resolution of \unit[2.5$\times$2.5$\times$2.5]{mm} for both
audio-description and movie data).
% preprocessing intro
On these data, the further preprocessing steps were performed by FEAT v6.00
(FMRI Expert Analysis Tool \citep{woolrich2001autocorr}) as shipped with FSL
v5.0.9 (\href{https://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl}{FMRIB's Software Library}
\citep{smith2004fsl}) to create the input data for the subsequent shared
response modelling to create the \ac{cms}.
%
The preprocessing steps closely resemble the processing that was previously
performed in \citet{sengupta2016extension} and in \citet{haeusler2022processing}
responsively.

\subsubsection{Functional localizer data}

\todo[inline]{cf. with VIS paper; see design-files}

% despiking
Every run of the functional localizer paradigm was despiked using AFNI's
\citep{cox1996afni, cox1997software} '3dDespike' command, and
slice-time-corrected.
% temporal filtering
High-pass temporal filtering was applied to every run using a Gaussian-weighted
least-squares straight line with a cutoff period of \unit[100]{s} to remove
low-frequency confounds.
% brain extraction
The brain was extracted from surrounding tissues using BET \citep{smith2002bet}.
% spatial smoothing
Data were spatially smoothed applying a Gaussian kernel with full width at half
maximum (FWHM) of \unit[4.0]{mm}
% normalization
A grand-mean intensity normalization of the entire 4D dataset was performed by a
single multiplicative factor.
% rerun the analysis: ./code/generate\_1st\_level\_design.sh condor\_submit

% temporal filtering
To every segment of the movie and audio-description, high-pass temporal
filtering was applied using a Gaussian-weighted least-squares straight line with
a cutoff period of \unit[150]{s} (sigma=\unit[75.0]{s}).
% brain extraction
The brain was extracted from surrounding tissues using BET \citep{smith2002bet},
% spatial smoothing
and data were spatially smoothed (Gaussian kernel, \unit[4.0]{mm}, FWHM).
% normalization
A grand-mean intensity normalization of the entire 4D dataset was performed by a
single multiplicative factor.
% pre-whithening
Correction for local autocorrelation in the time series (prewhitening) was
applied using FILM (FMRIB's Improved Linear Model \citep{woolrich2001autocorr})
to improve estimation efficiency.

\subsection{Modeling of a shared response space}

\todo[inline]{how to reliably (!) hyphenate links??}

Further analyses steps were performed via Python scripts that relied on

% FSL User Guide:
% filtered_func_data will normally have been temporally high-pass filtered,
% it is not zero mean; the mean value for each voxel's time course has been

% input: 'sub-*/run-?.feat/filtered_func_data.nii.gz' of VIS, AO, AV
% -> should already grand mean scaled

%
Given that FSL adds back the mean value for each voxel's time course at the end
of the preprocessing, mean values were subtracted again, and each voxels's time
course was multiplied by 10000 [using a Python script].

% data_mask_concat_runs.py: masks are not dilated and not masked with

% union of PPA masks
For each paradigm and subject, the corresponding 4d time-series of each run /
segment were masked with the union of individual PPA masks
\citep[s.][]{haeusler2022processing} that was warped from MNI space into each
subjects' space.
% AO FoV
Each subjects' data were further masked with the subject-specific \ac{fov} of
the audio-description.
%
The number of remaining voxels for each subject can be seen in Table
\ref{tab:ppamaskvoxels}.


\begin{table*}[btp]

%
The last 75 TRs of the audio-description were missing in subject-04 due to an
image reconstruction problem.
%
The \ac{srm} allows the number of voxels to be different across subjects but the
number of samples must be the same.
%
Hence, we removed the last 75 TRs of the audio-description from the other
subjects' time-series.
% it's only credits anyway; AO + AV has 7123 TRs; not 7198 volumes anymore;
% visual localizer has 156 TRs per run
As a result, the data to fit the \ac{srm} in the following step comprised 3599
TRs of the movie, 3524 TRs of audio-description, and 624 TRs of the visual
localizer experiment.

\todo[inline]{yeah, well, probably I should have cut the last run of AO first,
and then z-scored the last segment but anyway...; does not make much difference}


\paragraph{Fitting of shared response model}


\todo[inline]{mention that just 'ao \& av' as input were also tested?}

We used the probabilistic \ac{srm} algorithm implemented in BrainIAK v.11 (Brain
Imaging Analysis Kit, \citet{kumar2020brainiak, kumar2020brainiaktutorial},
http://brainiak.org) to fit the \ac{srm}.
%
This implementation approximates the \ac{srm} using the Expectation Maximization
(EM) algorithm proposed by \citep{chen2015reduced} optimized by
\citet{anderson2016enabling}.
%
We followed a leave-one-subject-out folding scheme [correct term?]:
%
for every subject $n$, we used the other subjects' ($N-1$) concatenated fMRI
responses to the movie, audio-description, and functional localizer as training
set to compute the shared feature space.
%
Concatenated time-series data were z-scored across experimental
paradigms.\todo{a second z-scoring}
% features
Considering the size of the ROIs the spatial resolution of the fMRI data, we
chose a value of $k=10$ for the number of features (i.e. the shared responses)
to be computed.
% n_iter
The number of iterations for the algorithm to minimize the error was set to 30.

%
During model fitting, the algorithm computes the shared feature space $S$ ($k$
features by $t$ time points) and calculates subject-specific, orthogonal [?]
transformation matrices $W_{n}$ ($v$ voxel by $k$ features).
%
These transformation matrices, or weight matrices, reflect the loadings of
voxels onto features [i.e. subject-specific functional topographies], and allow
to project responses of voxels within each subjects' \ac{roi}(s) from anatomical
space into the $k$-dimensional shared feature space, and thus functionally align
subjects.

\todo[inline]{negative control: I need to check the code; unfortunately, it is
still pretty early in the processing pipeline}

% shuffled data
As negative control, we shuffled the order of runs of audio-description and
movie (but not visual localizer) before fitting a shared response model to the
time-series.


\subsection{Alignment of left-out subjects}

% AO: 0-451, 0-892, 0-1330, 0-1818, 0-2280, 0-2719, 0-3261, 0-3524
% AV: 3524-3975, 3524-4416, 3524-4854, 3524-5342, 3524-5804, 3524-6243,
%     3524-6785, 3524-7123
% AO+AV: 0-7123

\todo[inline]{partial alignment: well, explanation makes sense in my head}
%
\todo[inline]{perform alignment with TRs of localizer for
cross-subject-prediction = model variation, ceiling ...}
%
\todo[inline]{s. get\_wmatrix\_for\_left-out.py: srm.transform\_subject calls
np.linalg.svd()}

``The weight matrices that we created from SRM data are not only useful for
projecting new data into a shared space but also for the reverse —
reconstructing data in subject space''.

%
We then aligned each left-out subject to the shared space $S$ that was computed
from the other subjects' data.
%
The algorithm learns a mapping $W_{n}$ of the left-out subject's anatomical
space into the shared space $S$ that is kept fixed.
%
Critically, in order evaluate the relationship between the length of the
stimulus that is used to align an ``unknown'' subject to a preexisting shared
space and prediction performance, we performed a \textit{partial alignment}:
%
We used an increasing number of segments (1 up to 8) of the naturalistic stimuli
per subject to let the algorithm learn the orthogonal mapping to the TRs of the
corresponding segment(s) in the shared space.
%
As a result, we obtained 8 transformation matrices per subject and per
naturalistic stimulus.
%
Each matrix has a size of $v$ voxels by $k$ features but is based on a different
quantity of data used to calculate the mapping [i.e. subject-specific functional
topographies].


\subsection{Estimation of scene-selective topography}

\todo[inline]{in both following cases the mean was computed in subject-specific
anatomical space; I also tested creating a template by computing the mean in
shared feature space; leads to pretty similar; but I did not create a template
by taking the mean in MNI space; estimation using anatomy has always been mean
of z-maps in subject-space in both cases}


%
To predict the results of the functional localizer (statistical $Z$-maps
representing functional topographies) of a left-out subject, we projected all
other participants $Z$-maps from their subject-specific anatomy into the shared
feature space, and from the shared feature space into the left-out subject's
anatomy.
%
As a benchmark to evaluate the performance of the estimation using functional
alignment, we similarly estimated each left-out subject's $Z$-map using
volume-based anatomical alignment.


\subsubsection{Prediction/estimation using \ac{cms}}

\todo[inline]{terminology: it is NOT the "inverse" but "transpose" matrix}

%
First, individual results from the visual localizer [and auditory naturalistic
stimulus] were masked (in each individuals' subject-space) with the union of PPA
masks group PPA.
%
Then, data were transformed from subject-specific, anatomical spaces into the
shared response space [by calling srm.transform(masked\_zmaps)'].
%
Using the transpose of the left-out subject's transformation matrix, the
$Z$-maps were projected from shared response space into the anatomical space of
the left-out subject.
%
The mean of the 13 projected $Z$-maps served as an estimation of the left-out
subject empirical $Z$-map (s. \citep{sengupta2016extension})


\subsubsection{Prediction using anatomical alignment}

\todo[inline]{tell more about how transformation matrices were created;
potential reviewer's question: your anatomical alignment might have been shitty,
linear etc. ?}

\todo[inline]{check TNT github/gin repo; what is the corresponding paper?}

%
We also estimated each left-out subject's $Z$-map using volume-based anatomical
alignment.
% into MNI
First, we warped the results of the visual localizer from each subjects'
space(bold3Tp2) into MNI space (grpbold3Tp2) using precomputed transformation
matrices that are part of the studyforrest dataset [LINK; cf. method section in
PPA-Paper].
% into left-out subject
Then, results of all subjects were warped from MNI space in to the left-out
subject's space
%
The transformed $Z$-maps were masked with mask of unions of PPAs and the
individual's \ac{fov}.
%
Finally, the mean of these $Z$-maps served as a prediction of the corresponding
left-out subject's empirical $Z$-map.


\subsection{Quantifying the performance}


\subsubsection{Correlation stuff}

%
To quantify the performance of our estimations based on different number of runs
of the movie and audio-description, we calculated the Pearson's correlation
coefficients between the empirical $Z$-maps from the localizer experiment [and
audio-description] and estimated $Z$-map based on other subject's data.

%
Further we compared these correlations to the reliability [internal
consistency?] of visual localizer using Cronbach's Alpha based on the
variability across runs [as did
\citep{jiahui2020predicting}].

\subsubsection{Cronbach's Alpha of localizer}

\todo[inline]{s. 'studyforrest-srm-movies/test/statistics\_cronbachs.py'}

\todo[inline]{script is apparently written; tbh, did not take a close look at
the result or just cannot remember; it will be mention 'pro forma' anyway}


\subsection{backup: alternative template creation}
%
lastly, we currently apply another method to get the „z-map template“ on which
the prediction is based ('test/data\_denoise-vis.py';
'test/data\_srm-vis-to-ind.py')
%
From \citep{jiahui2020predicting} (an approach different from ours): ``We
estimated a participant's map from other participants' data by first projecting
all other participants' localizer data into that participant's cortical anatomy
and calculating the GLM univariate contrast map of faces versus all other
categories for each run in each other participant then averaging t-values across
the maps (56 maps for StudyForrest, 14 subjects x 4 runs for each; 80 maps for

``An added benefit is that SRM helps address the data starvation problem above:
because the SRM space is by definition shared across individuals, data from
multiple participants can be combined prior to MVPA or other analyses''

\subsection{Prediction-related}

\todo[inline]{predict\_ppa.py: outputs also the Pearson correlations}

``We estimated each participant's face-selectivity map based on that
participant’s localizer data [anatomical alignment], based on other
participants' localizer data projected into that participant's cortical anatomy
using hyperalignment and anatomical surface alignment (see Fig. 1)
\citep{jiahui2020predicting}''.

``We correlated the whole-cortex contrast map (faces-vs-all) based on a
participant’s own data with the maps estimated from other participants’ data
separately for the StudyForrest and Grand Budapest datasets. After 1-step
hyperalignment, the mean Pearson correlation values across participants were
0.58 (StudyForrest, N = 15, S.D. = 0.08)'' \citep{jiahui2020predicting}.

``Hyperalignment greatly improved the prediction performance compared with
anatomical surface alignment. With surface alignment, the average Pearson
correlation values across participants were 0.40 (N = 15, S.D. = 0.08) and 0.50
(N = 21, S.D. = 0.06) in the StudyForrest and Grand Budapest datasets,
respectively (Fig. 3). The difference between the hyperaligned and the
surface-aligned mean correlation values was highly significant (StudyForrest:
t(14) = 17.39, p < 0.001)'' \citep{jiahui2020predicting}.

\ac{srm} is significant.


\subsubsection{show plots of brain slices?}

\todo[inline]{talk during seminar showed (quick screenshot in FSL) from sub-04
as an example}.

%% We have these nice blurry EPI-images and all z-maps are threshold at a value of bigger than 2.3.

% always in red, we can see the z-map from the localizer experiment across the whole brain,

% the region of interest that we used is white and the predicted values, are blue

% The prediction using anatomical alignment and the prediction using 15 minutes of movie data show a correlation of about .7

% the prediction using 15 minutes of the audio-description correlates about 0 with the empirical z-map

% The last one is the extreme case, but it can give you an idea of how the z-maps look in a slice of the brain

\todo[inline]{I guess, I could adjust script that plots the brain slices for the
PPA-paper (without losing my mind?); but script expects standard brain in MNI
space; transformation of prediction into MNI (again?); and it is just about the
ROI not about the whole brain; standard space could be substituted with (nice
blurry) subject-specific functional template}


\subsubsection{plot\_bland-altman.py}

\subsubsection{Estimation of localizer from localizer TRs}

just "cross-subject" but not "cross-experiment-cross-subject" prediction"


\subsubsection{Cronbach's Alpha of localizer}


all from \citep{jiahui2020predicting}: ``We compared the correlations between
maps estimated from a participant's own data and maps estimated from other
participants' data to the reliability of the localizer. We computed the
reliability of the contrast maps with Cronbach's Alpha based on variability
across the four localizer runs for each set. The mean Cronbach's Alpha between
the four localizer runs was 0.60 (N = 15, S.D. = 0.14) in the StudyForrest
dataset [...](Fig. 2)''.
%
``These results mean that if we scan each participant for another 4 localizer
runs, and compute the correlation between the two maps (4 runs vs. 4 runs), the
correlation would be 0.60 on average in the StudyForrest''.
%
``Cronbach's alpha indicates that the predicted contrast map based on
hyperalignment is close to or as good as the real contrast map based on four
localizer runs (StudyForrest: t(14) = 0.61, p = 0.55; Grand Budapest: t(20) =
3.02, p = 0.007)''.
%
``In the StudyForrest dataset, the predicted contrast map based on
hyperalignment was better than the contrast map based on data from three out of
four localizer runs in other participants (t(14) = 2.36, p = 0.03) and in Grand
Budapest, the predicted contrast map was comparable to the contrast map based on
three localizer runs in other participants (t(20) = 0.48, p = 0.63)''.
%
``A scatterplot of the individual correlation values with hyperalignment and
with surface alignment (Fig 3), shows that predicted maps based on
hyperalignment were more accurate than those based on surface alignment in every
participant''.


\section{Discussion}


\subsection{Short Summary}

What we did. What the results are

\subsection{Discussion of current results}

Results indicate that we are able to use multiple subjects to learn a
10-dimensional shared space for the fMRI data that increases performance on our
experiments.
%
15 min of movie watching used for functional alignment outperform prediction
using anatomical alignment
%
30 minutes of movie watching outperform 15 minutes of movie watching
%
more than 30 minutes do not lead to a significantly improved prediction
performance.

\subsection{self-critique; short comings}


\subsubsection{localizer is ``ground truth''}


``The dynamic localizer (in Grand Budapest data set) was significantly more
reliable than the static localizer (in StudyForrest data set) (t(34) = 3.76, p <
0.001) despite its shorter length (four 234s runs versus four 312s runs,
respectively)'' \citep{jiahui2020predicting}.


From \citep{weiner2018defining}: ``the identification of the PPA is complicated
by (at least) four methodological considerations. First, the PPA definition may
depend on the type of experiment, task, and stimuli used. Second, the boundaries
of the PPA may depend on the statistical threshold used. Third, the spatial
extent and localization of the PPA may vary if defined within the native brain
space of an individual or based on a group analysis. Fourth, the size of the PPA
may depend on data acquisition choices (e.g. large vs. small voxels) and data
analysis choices (e.g. liberal smoothing vs. no spatial smoothing). The present
study aims to identify and to predict the most probable location of
place-selective voxels within medial VTC of an individual brain that is
impervious to these methodological decisions'' \citep{weiner2018defining}.

\citet{lilienfeld2015fifty} on ``gold standard'': ``In the domains of
psychological and psychiatric assessment, there are precious few, if any,
genuine ``gold standards''. Essentially all measures, even those with high
levels of validity for their intended purposes, are necessarily fallible
indicators of their respective constructs [Cronbach and Meehl, 1955; Faraone and
Tsuang, 1994]. As a consequence, the widespread practice referring to even
well-validated measures of personality or psychopathology, such as Hare’s
(1991/2003) Psychopathy Checklist-Revised, as ``gold standards'' for their
respective constructs [Ermer et al., 2012] is misleading [see Skeem and Cooke,
2010]. If authors intend to refer to measures as ``extensively validated'', they
should simply do so'' \citep{lilienfeld2015fifty}

\citet{scheinost2019ten} in context of phenotypic measures: ``Predictive models
based on neuroimaging data will only ever account for a fraction of the
variance. Neuroimaging studies are limited by how much information the signal
can capture about the measure of interest. At the same time, these studies are
also limited by the chosen phenotypic measure used.  While the success of a
model is evaluated by how well it predicts a phenotypic measure (and these
phenotypic measures have to be treated as gold standards), it is well known that
such measures are not always the ground truth but themselves suffer from
confounds and noise.  When studying brain-behavior associations, one must keep
in mind how extraordinary it is that neuroimaging data can be distilled to
approximate phenotypic measures that reflect a simplification of multiple
complex features. Thus, even modest results are reasonable and remarkable. For
a discussion on the reliability of phenotypic measures in the context of
predictive modeling, we point the interested reader to: [Dubois et al., 2018a,
2018b; Gignac and Bates, 2017]'' \citep{scheinost2019ten}.


\subsubsection{volume-based registration vs. surface-based normalization}
%
Volume vs. surface: e.g. \citep{desai2005volumetric}

Sengupta did analyses in volume space;
%
I could have run the analyses/contrasts on the surface
%
but: opportunity costs?
%
in a broader broader context as an issue of data sharing (if at all, a point for
general discussion); how well can you trust data that you did not collect
yourself (a.k.a. ``did you consider x?'', ``no, does not matter in our case'',
``but will matter for the person who will use/have used your data'')

Compare to hyperalignment or Multimodal Surface Matching (Robinson et al. 2014)


\subsubsection{SRM and (dropped) individual idiosyncrasies}

``The flip side of focusing on shared responses is to focus on responses that
are idiosyncratic to individuals.
%
Although these responses are excluded in SRM, they are not necessarily noise and
may in fact be highly reliable within participants.
%
SRM can be used to isolate participant-unique responses by examining the
residuals after removing shared group responses, or it can be applied
hierarchically to the residuals to identify subgroups \citep{chen2017shared}
\citep{cohen2017computational} [this other ``Chen'' is fucking up the aethestics
of references].
%
More generally, there is a growing trend toward investigating individual
differences as another source of meaningful variance in fMRI [73].
%
Recognizing that signal exists beyond the average or shared response of a group,
such studies exploit idiosyncratic but stable responses to account for
previously unexplained variance in brain function, behavioral performance and
clinical measures [70,74]'' \citep{cohen2017computational}.





\subsection{Future questions}

\todo[inline]{mih: Das Ende von Kapitel drei braucht aus meiner Sicht keinen
eigenen "Outlook", der kommt eh direkt danach für die ganze Arbeit und ist da
viel Interessanter}

\subsubsection{predict other t-contrasts of higher-visual area localizer}

\subsubsection{predict other localizers}
%
e.g. retinotopy, language areas


\subsubsection{create CMS from other study}
%
we currently have a cross-subject and cross-experiment prediction,
but we do not have a (real) cross-scanner prediction
%
create a CMS from another experiment’s data,
using another scanner and hopefully more subjects
%
In case of an alignment of time-series,
that experiment needs, at least, a part of Forrest Gump as an intersection


\subsubsection{ROI vs. whole-brain / searchlight}
%
Our union of PPA is XX voxels big.
%
Influence of voxel count on performance; take searchlight (but how big should it
be?

% Guntupalli's searchlight paper
Later, \citet{guntupalli2016model} showed that this approach can be extended to
predict functional organization across large proportions of the cortical
surface, for example to predict the represented visual field coordinate in
visual cortex based on retinotopic mapping scans of other individuals

``Applying SRM to a large swath of the brain means that all voxels within the
region contribute to the final derived metric. This can conflict with the goal
of associating spatially local activity with specific cognitive functions. To
address such issues, SRM can be applied in small overlapping searchlights to
obtain localized metrics of shared information [71,99]
\citep{cohen2017computational}''.


\subsubsection{connectivity-based}

\todo[inline]{wtf did \citep{nastase2019leveraging} do?}

\todo[inline]{kind of a killer cause you do not need intersection of
time-series; but s. Guntupalli's paper: time-series hyperalignment outperforms
connectivity-based hyperalignment (?)}

% from project proposal
``In his doctoral thesis, recently submitted to the Faculty of Natural Sciences
in Magdeburg, Falko Kaule showed that congruent time-locked BOLD responses
across subjects (i.e. all subjects watching the exact same full-length movie) as
used by Haxby and colleagues are not required to derive a valid alignment of
individuals with a common representational space \citep{kaule2017examination}.
%
Comparable prediction performance can be achieved by using \textbf{functional
connectivity patterns} (correlation of a voxel's time series with reference
regions in the same brain)'' (s. dissertation project proposal).


% Nastase's ugly mofo paper
``Finally, estimating the SRM from functional connectivity
data rather than response time series circumvents the need for a single shared
stimulus across subjects; connectivity SRM allows us to derive a single shared
response space across different stimuli with a shared connectivity profile
\citep{nastase2019leveraging}'' \citep{kumar2020brainiak}.




\subsection{Vision}

``Calibration scan'' to align to \ac{cms} and atlas of reference group.
%
Once a valid alignment is established, known functional properties of a
(normative) reference, derived from extensive scans and analysis of other
subjects, can then be projected into the respective individual voxel space (s.
Fig. 1 in \citep{nishimoto2016lining}).
%
Imagine you scan a new, unknown subject for just 15 minutes more, and you
additionally get results from a whole variety of other paradigms mapped onto
that brain
%
Results from localizers of low-level perceptual processes, but also higher-level
cognitive processes like language, memory, emotions and so on
%
Kinda ``adventurous'':If you have different common model spaces for different
subgroups, you can investigate which alignment onto which ``subgroup common
model space'' results in less error, that lets you classify to which subgroup
your new subject might belong.


\subsection{Conclusion}
