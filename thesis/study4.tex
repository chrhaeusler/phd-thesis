\section{Introduction}

\todo[inline]{intro is pretty similar to general introduction}

% brain mapping
``Mapping the functional neuroanatomy of the human brain is one of the
fundamental goals of neuroscience research. Lesion studies following stroke
provided critical early information that specific functions such as motor
function or language were consistently localized to certain parts of the
cerebral cortex'' \citep{satterthwaite2015towards}.
%
Neuroimaging studies have parcellated the cerebral cortex into distinctive
\textit{functional areas} by topographically mapping brain functions, perceptual
or cognitive processes, onto the brain's anatomy.
% higher visual areas higher visual areas
In the domain of higher-visual perception, replicated findings suggest that
functionally defined, category-selective brain regions like the parahippocampal
place area (\ac{ppa}, \citep{epstein1998ppa}), the fusiform face area (\ac{ffa},
\citep{kanwisher1997ffa}), or the extrastriate body are (\ac{eba}
\citep{downing2001bodyarea}) exhibit significantly increased \ac{bold} activity
correlated with a ``preferred'' stimulus class.

\todo[inline]{cf. general intro \& papers; add involved gyri}
% ppa
The \ac{ppa}, for example, exhibits increased \ac{bold} activation when subjects
passively view photos of landscapes and compared to other stimuli like tools or
faces \citep{aguirre1998area, epstein1998ppa}.


\subsection{Functional localizer}

\todo[inline]{cf. general intro; longer text here or in general intro?}

% example: higher functional areas
The ``topographies of category-selective areas are mostly distributed similarly
across individuals, but great individual variability exists in the locus, the
size, and the shape of the category-selective areas \citep{zhen2015quantifying,
zhen2017quantifying} '' \citep{jiahui2020predicting}.

\todo[inline]{give example of study regarding variability of PPA here}
\todo[inline]{cite paper(s) that does not estimate individual location from
reference 'cause these papers will be cited in ``The solution: estimation from
reference data''}

For example, \citep{frost2012measuring, weiner2018defining,
rosenke2021probabilistic, wang2015probabilistic} have shown that...


% localizer
Traditionally, location, size, and shape of functional areas are determined by
letting study participants perform a task during a \textit{functional localizer}
paradigm.
%
``To deal with the idiosyncratic topography of functional areas,
category-selective areas are identified separately in each individual using a
``functional localizer'' fMRI scan'' \citep{jiahui2020predicting}.
%
``Functional localizers use a simple contrast between responses to different
categories of stimuli, such as responses to faces versus responses to objects,
to identify category-selective areas or to map a category-selectivity topography
[\citep{saxe2006divide}]'' \citep{jiahui2020predicting}.


\subsubsection{The problem (with functional localizers)}

% problem: one localizer for one domain
Functional localizers are designed to maximize detection power and thus
dedicated to map just one domain of brain functions.
% which gets messy
Consequently, if one wants to map a variety of domains, the approach ``one
paradigm for one domain of functions'' gets time-consuming and inefficient.
% localizer batteries: intro
Researchers have tried to tackle that issue by creating time-efficient
multi-functional \textit{localizer batteries} (e.g., \citep{barch2013function,
drobyshevsky2006rapid, pinel2007fast}).
% task based = shit
Nevertheless, the diagnostic quality of localizer batteries relies heavily on
the participant's comprehension of the task instruction and general compliance,
a criterion that can be difficult to meet in clinical or pediatric populations.


\subsection{The solution: estimation from reference data}

% prediction: general idea
Another approach to reduce time and costs of individual diagnostics is to
estimate the location of a functional area based on data collected in a
reference group.


\subsubsection{Anatomical alignment}


\paragraph{Estimation via anatomical alignment}
%
A traditional procedure \citep{frost2012measuring, weiner2018defining,
zhen2017quantifying, zhen2015quantifying, rosenke2021probabilistic,
wang2015probabilistic} [check; cite just the best(s)] to estimate a person's
functional topography from a reference group starts by anatomically aligning a
person's structural and functional data to a \textit{common anatomical space}
(i.e. a brain template) in order to resolve anatomical variability across
persons.
% volume-based
Volume-based anatomical alignment (s. \citep{klein2009evaluation} for a review)
aligns voxel-wise data of individual subjects to a three-dimensional brain
template (e.g. MNI152 template; \citep{fonov2011unbiased}).
% surface-based
Surface-based anatomical alignment \citep{fischl1999cortical} aligns vertex-wise
data of individual subjects to a two-dimensional template (e.g. FreeSurfer
fsaverage template; \citep{fischl1999high}).
% estimation
In a second step, the most probable location of a functional area in a person's
anatomy is then estimated by projecting functional data from persons in the
reference group through the common anatomical space into the individual person's
brain anatomy.


\paragraph{studies that estimated functional areas using anatomical alignment}

\todo[inline]{2 examples should be enough}

For example,  \citep{frost2012measuring, weiner2018defining,
zhen2017quantifying, zhen2015quantifying, rosenke2021probabilistic,
wang2015probabilistic} [same refs as above] have shown that ...

\todo[inline]{most studies did binary estimation (voxel belongs to PPA or not)
based on subjectively chosen thresholds; we estimate unthresholded $Z$-maps!}

\todo[inline]{check that in other studies and make that point more clear in
intro, method section, and discussion}


\paragraph{Functional-anatomical correspondence}

% definition: functional-anatomical correspondence
However, location, size and shape of category-selective regions can differ
across individuals by millimeters or centimeters [\citep{zhen2017quantifying,
zhen2015quantifying}] \citep{feilong2018reliable}.
%
Surface-based inter-subject alignments / strategies for registering individual
brains together that respect cortical foldings \citep{fischl1999cortical,
yeo2009spherical} has been shown to reduce the variability in
\textit{functional--anatomical correspondence} \citep{feilong2018reliable,
kumar2020brainiak} across persons \citep{klein2010evaluation,
frost2012measuring} [but see \citep{langers2014assessment}]

%
Cortical surface-based alignment \citep{fischl2012freesurfer} that respects
sulcal locations can reduce the mismatch between brain function and anatomy of
category-selective regions \citep{duncan2009consistency, frost2012measuring,
weiner2018defining, weiner2014mid} [still similar phrasing to
\citep{feilong2018reliable}].
%
Nevertheless, surface-based alignment [\citep{fischl2012freesurfer}] does not
eliminate the mismatch between brain function and anatomy of category-selective
regions \citep{duncan2009consistency, frost2012measuring, weiner2018defining,
weiner2014mid}[still similar phrasing to \citep{feilong2018reliable}].

\todo[inline]{seems to work better with low-level areas}
%
``These systems provide better alignment across subjects for retinotopic visual
areas [\citep{fischl1999high}], but they do not do much better than Talairach
co-ordinates for category-selective regions in the temporal lobe
[\citep{spiridon2006location}]'' \citep{saxe2006divide}.


\subsubsection{Functional alignment (FA)}

\todo[inline]{I introduce the term ``common functional space'' as an umbrella
term for common model space (hyperalingment) and shared feature space / shared
response model (SRM)}

\paragraph{Explanation of functional alignment}

% intro
Since anatomical alignment addresses the issue of anatomical variability but
does not consider variability in functional-anatomical correspondence across
subjects, algorithms --- like \textit{hyperalignment} \citep{haxby2011common,
guntupalli2016model} or the \textit{shared response model}
\citep{chen2015reduced, zhang2016searchlight} --- have been developed that aim
to functionally align voxels (or surface vertices).
%
In order to preserve functional idiosyncrasies across persons,
\textit{functional alignment} algorithms do not align voxels (or surface
vertices) that share the same anatomical location, voxels are aligned that share
similar functional properties.
%
Therefore, functional topographies are not aligned to a three-dimensional,
common anatomical space but to a high-dimensional, \textit{common functional
space}.
%
The construction of the common functional space can be based on the maximization
of the inter-subject similarity of \ac{bold} response time series correlating
with a time-locked external stimulation \citep{haxby2011common, chen2015reduced,
sabuncu2010function}, or based on the inter-subject similarity of connectivity
profiles \citep{feilong2018reliable, guntupalli2018computational,
nastase2019leveraging}.
%
Additionally, functional alignment algorithms also compute subject-specific
transformation matrices that can be used to project functional data into the
common functional space \citep{haxby2020hyperalignment}.
%
Vice versa, the transpose of a subject-specific transformation matrix can be
used to project data from the common functional space into a subject's
anatomical space.


\paragraph{works better with naturalistic stimuli}

\todo[inline]{does not fit in here; but needs to be mentioned somewhere}

\todo[inline]{check \citet{guntupalli2016model, haxby2011common}, again...}

%
Functional alignment based on response time series can be applied to fMRI data
from paradigms with simplified stimuli, but it has been shown that data from
naturalistic stimuli provide increased validity of common functional space and
increased generalizability of transformation matrices [to what?], presumably
because such experiments sample a broader range of brain states
\citep{haxby2011common, guntupalli2016model}.


\paragraph{Estimation via functional alignment (=current use case)}

\todo[inline]{streamline procedures of estimation via anatomical und functional
alignment; use same phrasing in both parts}

%
Hence, a more recent procedure to estimate a person's functional topography from
a reference group first aligns structural and functional data to a common
anatomical space. Then, in order to preserve functional idiosyncrasies across
persons, the procedure additionally performs a functional alignment to
the higher-dimensional, common functional space.
% estimation
In the last step, the most probable location of a functional area in a person's
anatomy is not estimated by projecting functional data from persons in the
reference group through the common anatomical space but by projecting data
through a common functional space into the individual person's brain anatomy.


\paragraph{studies that estimated functional areas using functional alignment}

\todo[inline]{report length / no. of samples used for alignment of left-out
subjects}

%
For example, \citet{haxby2011common, guntupalli2016model} have shown that
``idiosyncratic topographies for category-selectivity and retinotopy can be
estimated in individual brains with high fidelity using hyperalignment to
project other subjects' functional localizer data into a target subject's
ventral temporal and occipital cortical anatomy'' \citep{jiahui2020predicting}
using (half) of the audio-visual movie Grand Budapest Hotel ($\sim$50 min; 1s
repetition time) and Forrest Gump ($\sim$120m; 2s repetition time)
\citep{hanke2016simultaneous}.
%
``In this study we demonstrate that a subject’s idiosyncratic functional
topography can be estimated with high fidelity from that subject’s fMRI data
obtained while watching a naturalistic movie using hyperalignment to project
other subjects’ localizer data into that subject’s idiosyncratic cortical
anatomy'' \citep{jiahui2020predicting}.
%
Their ``findings show that individually-tailored maps estimated from other
subjects’ data after hyperalignment correlate much more highly with maps
estimated from that subject's own localizer data than does a group average map
based on anatomical normalization'' \citep{jiahui2020predicting}.

%
``Here, we show that precise mapping of functional topographies in a new subject
can be achieved using hyperalignment and a database of movie and localizer data
from other subjects'' \citep{jiahui2020predicting}.


\subsection{Here, we...}


\subsubsection{Intro}

% summary in one sentence
Here, we estimate the results (statistical $Z$-maps) of a visual localizer
paradigm in one subject (i.e. the ``test subject'') based on data from other
subjects (i.e. the ``training subjects'').
%
Focussing on the \ac{ppa}, we compare the prediction performance of a
volume-based, anatomical alignment procedure to a volume-based, functional
alignment procedure.

\todo[inline]{...and evaluate the necessary length needed}

%
We employ the \ac{srm} \citep{chen2015reduced, richard2019fast} in order to
estimate subject-specific $Z$-maps gained from visual localizer experiment that
aimed to localize the \ac{ppa} from a reference group.


\subsubsection{Shared response model}

%
The \ac{srm} is an unsupervised probabilistic latent-factor model that
decomposes \ac{fmri} responses time series of participants experiencing the same
stimulus into a lower-dimensional space of shared feature (i.e. the common
functional space) and subject-specific orthogonal topographic transformation
matrices \citep{kumar2020brainiak, cohen2017computational}.

%
The \ac{srm} approach warps individual representational geometry into a common
functional space of pre-specified lower dimensionality and appears to filter out
noise and reduces overfitting [kind phrasing from
\citep{haxby2020hyperalignment}].
%
The dimensions do not correspond to individual voxels but \textit{shared
features} that can be understood as a weighted sum of many voxels distributed
across the full voxel space of each subject
\citep{kumar2020brainiak}.
%
The subject-specific transformation matrices perform a mapping from each
specific's idiosyncratic voxel space into the shared feature space
\citep{kumar2020brainiak, cohen2017computational}.
%
``The learned subject-specific topographic bases can be used to project test
data into the shared space. This projection functionally aligns the test data''
\citep{kumar2020brainiak}.
% transpose
The transpose of the matrix can be used to map data from shared space into
a subjects' anatomy.


\paragraph{the math shit}

\todo[inline]{merge into text above? or move into method section?}
\todo[inline]{at the moment, I think it's better placed in the methods}

%
More specifically, ``the brain data for each participant $i$ are represented as
an \textbf{$n$} voxel by $t$ time matrix  $X_{i}$. A pre-specified number of
features are used to learn a $k$ feature by  $t$ time shared space $S$ and a
participant-specific $n$ voxel by $k$  feature matrix $W_{i}$. This weight
matrix, reflecting the loading of voxels onto features, is randomly initialized
then fit over iterations to minimize the error in explaining participant data.
At the same time, the time course of the features in the shared space is
learned'' (from https://brainiak.org/tutorials/11-SRM/).

%
``SRM learns $N$ maps $W_{i}$ with orthogonal columns such that
$||X_{i}-W_{i}S||_{F}$ is minimized over $\left\{ W_{i}\right\} _{i=1}^{N},S$,
where $X_{i}\in\mathbb{R}^{v\times{T}}$ is the $i^{th}$ subject's fMRI response
($v$ voxels by $T$ repetition times) and $S\in\mathbb{R}^{k\times{T}}$ is a
feature time-series in a $k$-dimensional shared space''
\citep{vodrahalli2018mapping}.


\subsubsection{Our procedure}

\todo[inline]{I am confused, we have leave-one-out but k-folds?}

% creating the shared feature space
Following a k-fold leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, we compute a shared
response model for every test subject based on publicly available fMRI data
\href{www.studyforrest.org}{studyforrest.org} of training subjects participating
in the visual localizer paradigm \citep{sengupta2016extension} but also watching
a Hollywood \citep{hanke2016simultaneous} movie and listening to the movie's
audio-description \citep{hanke2014audiomovie}.

\todo[inline]{does following make sense at all? if, I'll write it better}
%
Results of our previous study suggest that the movie and the audio-description
of Forrest Gump also sample the response vector space of ``spatial responses''
time-locked across subjects similarly to the visual localizer.
% align left-out subject
Assuming that the naturalistic stimuli would trigger, among others, brain
responses that are similar to those triggered by the functional localizer, we
used time series data of the naturalistic stimuli to align the left-out subject
to the fixed common functional space.
% project into common functional space
All other subjects' data of functional localizer are projected into the shared
feature space.
%
Finally, we projected from the common functional space into a left-out subject's
cortical anatomy


\paragraph{partial alignment}

\todo[inline]{Jeez! Phrasing! Just shorten it; speak of stimulus length}

%
Critically, we also evaluate the stimulus length (i.e. the amount of data) that
is needed to generate transformation matrices that ``outperforms'' a
prediction/estimation based on mere anatomical alignment.

% phrasing 1
For that reason, we assess the relationship between the prediction performance
based on the functional alignment and the quantity of data used to calculate
subject-specific transformation matrices that we use to project the functional
data from the common functional space into a subject's anatomy.

% phrasing 2
In other words, we test which amount of data is needed to perform an alignment
to the common functional space that provides transformation matrices that
outperform a prediction based on an anatomical alignment.


\paragraph{model validation; within experiment estimation}

\todo[inline]{imo, it's too much to mention it here}
\todo[inline]{but mention in method, results (plots?!), discussion ?}
\todo[inline]{adjust scripts and plot it, too}

%
``Between-subject models with SRM can, in some cases, exceed the performance of
within-subject models because (a) the reduced-dimension shared space can
highlight stimulus-related variance by filtering out noisy or
non-stimulus-related features, and (b) the between-subject model can effectively
leverage a larger volume of data after functional alignment than is available
for any single subject'' \citep{kumar2020brainiak}.
%
Hence, we also test alignment based on 15 minutes (?) of data from the visual
localizer to acquire the transformation matrices and perform a
cross-subject-prediction (vs. cross-subject-cross-experiment-prediction)


\subsection{Hypotheses}

\todo[inline]{Phrasing!; cf. general introduction}

%
We hypothesized that increased quantity of data used to calculate the
transformation matrices of left-out subjects for a functional alignment would to
increased prediction performance.
%
Further, we hypothesized that functional alignment based on ``sufficient''
quantity of data would eventually perform ``better'' than an estimation based on
anatomical alignment.


\subsection{Summary of results}

%
``Results expands previous analysis from ventral temporal cortex to the whole
cortex, showing strong correlations of face-selectivity topographic maps derived
from a subject's own localizer data with maps derived from other subjects'
localizer data projected into that subject's cortical anatomy. Both the two-step
algorithm and the new one-step algorithm, which we introduce here, produce
high-fidelity, individualized topographic maps, but the new one-step algorithm
maps were superior'' \citep{jiahui2020predicting}.


\subsection{Vision}

\todo[inline]{smallish text should be enough here}


\subsubsection{Naturalistic stimulus as multiple localizer}

\todo[inline]{cf. general introduction}

\paragraph{Validity \& generalizability}

\todo[inline]{generalizability: scan once, estimate many}
% from project proposal
Naturalistic stimuli promise an ``increased validity of derived transformation
for functional alignment by sampling a more diverse set of mental states that
reflect (confound) statistics of the natural environment, and enable
investigation of the acquired data for a variety of research questions (e.g.
visual or auditory perception, spatial cognition; emotion; music, speech or
social perception)'' [project proposal].

% from Haxby 2020
``Estimating the parameters to transform high-dimensional spaces from individual
brains into a common high-dimensional space requires a rich set of data that
samples a wide variety of cortical patterns in order to generalize to novel
stimuli or tasks. For response hyperalignment, a rich variety of stimuli or
conditions are necessary to sample the response vector space. For connectivity
hyperalignment, the sampling of connectivity vector space is defined by the
selection of connectivity targets, but the richness and reliability of
connectivity estimates depends on the variety of brain states over which
connectivity is estimated'' \citep{haxby2020hyperalignment}.


\paragraph{additional benefit: compliance}
%
``As a rule of thumb, SRM will improve sensitivity for detecting a cognitive
process of interest in the test data if the training stimuli or trials strongly
and variably engage that process in a way that is reliable across participants''
\citep{cohen2017computational}.

%
``Movies are more engaging and result in better compliance
\citep{vanderwal2015inscapes}. Movie viewing can also be used in subject
populations, such as children \citep{richardson2018development} or patients,
that may have trouble maintaining attention during repetitions of a tedious
localizer task'' \citep{jiahui2020predicting}.

%
``Movies engage multiple brain systems in parallel. From a single movie dataset
multiple functional topographies can be estimated (Guntupalli et al., 2016),
whereas different localizers are typically required to map different functional
topographies, making a thorough mapping of selective topographies
time-consuming and inefficient. Movies also simulate better the statistics of
natural viewing and listening and may provide more ecologically valid maps.
Analogously, the introduction of dynamic videos of faces and control categories
to localize face-selective topographies provides more reliable maps and better
estimate the extent of face-selective regions than do localizers with still
image stimuli (Fox et al., 2009; Pitcher et al., 2011). Similarly, naturalistic
stimuli may better sample the full range of responses to faces and other stimuli
that contribute to face-selective topographies'' \citep{jiahui2020predicting}.

\paragraph{in general}

Last paragraph of \citet{jiahui2020predicting}'s introduction: ``These results
lay a foundation for building a computational tool with a database that could
allow others to map multiple functional topographies in new subjects using only
data collected during movie viewing. Functional localizers are inefficient
because they only estimate one or a few topographies for each localizer. Movies,
by contrast, engage in parallel multiple neural systems for vision, audition,
language, person perception, social cognition, and other functions.
Consequently, movies have the potential to estimate selective topographies in
all of these do- mains. Such a tool would require a database of data for movies
and a range of functional localizers in a normative group of subjects. A new
subject’s functional topographies could be estimated based only on that
subject’s movie data and other subjects’ localizer data from the normative
database that could be projected into that subject’s cortical anatomy using
hyperalignment transformation matrices derived from movie data. Such a resource
would be more efficient and replace tedious functional localizers with an
engaging movie and could enable mapping of multiple functional topographies with
data from a single fMRI using a naturalistic stimulus''
\citet{jiahui2020predicting}.

``The algorithm also can be applied to simpler, con- trolled experimental data,
but our previous results showed that the sampling of response vectors from these
experiments is impoverished and produces a model representational space that
does not generalize well to new stimuli in other experiments (Haxby et al.
2011). Results show that the computational principles underlying this common
model have broad general validity for representational spaces in occipital,
temporal, parietal, and frontal cortices'' \citep{guntupalli2016model}.

An exhaustive description of the participants, stimulus creation, procedure,
stimulation setup, and fMRI acquisition can be found in the corresponding
publications. Following is a summary of the most important aspects.


\subsection{Participants}

\todo[inline]{following phrasing is almost identical to study2}
% VIS study
In the block-design localizer study \citep{sengupta2016extension}, 15
participants took part in a six-category block-design visual localizer.
% AV study
In the movie study \citep{hanke2016simultaneous}, the same 15 participants
(21–39 years, mean age 29.4, six female), watched the audio-visual movie
``Forrest Gump'' \citep{ForrestGumpMovie} with dubbed German audio track
\citep{ForrestGumpDVD}.
% AD study
In the audio-description study \citep{hanke2014audiomovie}, 20 German native
speakers (all right-handed, age 21–38 years, mean age 26.6 years, 12 male), of
whom 15 participants also took part in the localizer and movie study, listened
to the German audio-description \citep{ForrestGumpGermanAD} of the movie.
% participants' health
All participants reported to have normal hearing, normal or corrected-to-normal
vision, and no known history of neurological disorders.
% compensation, consent and shit
In all studies, participants received monetary compensation and gave written
informed consent for their participation and for public sharing of obtained data
in anonymized form. The studies had prior approval by the Ethics Committee of
Otto-von-Guericke University of Magdeburg, Germany.


\subsection{Stimuli and procedure}

\todo[inline]{following phrasing is almost identical to PPA-Paper}

\subsubsection{Functional localizer}

% VIS study picture categories
Stimuli for the block-design localizer study were 24 unique grayscale images of
faces, bodies, objects, houses, outdoor scenes and scrambled images, matched in
luminance and size, that were previously used in other studies
\citep[e.g.,][]{haxby2011common}.
% procedure: presentation & instructions
Participants performed a one-back image matching task for four block-design
runs, with two \unit[16]{s} blocks per stimulus category in each run.
%
For details on stimulus creation and presentation see
\citet{sengupta2016extension}.


\subsubsection{Naturalistic stimuli}
% AD & AV stimulus name & references
The German DVD release \citep{ForrestGumpDVD} of the movie ``Forrest Gump''
\citep{ForrestGumpMovie} and its temporally aligned audio-description
\citep{ForrestGumpGermanAD} served as naturalistic stimuli, with an approximate
duration of two hours, split into eight consecutive segments of
\unit[$\approx$15]{minutes}.
% AD: additional narrator
The audio-description adds another male narrator to the voice-over narration of
the main character Forrest Gump. This additional narration describes essential
aspects of the visual scenery when there is no off-screen voice, dialog, or
other relevant auditory content.
% task
For all sessions with naturalistic stimuli, participants were instructed to
inhibit physical movements except for eye-movements, and otherwise to simply
``enjoy the presentation''.
%
For details on stimulus creation and presentation see
\citet{hanke2014audiomovie, hanke2016simultaneous}.


\subsection{Stimulation setup}

\todo[inline]{following phrasing is almost identical to PPA-Paper}

% instructions and distance; screen size \unit[23.75 $\times$ 10.25]{cm}
In the block-design localizer, movie study, and audio-description study, visual
instructions were presented on a rear-projection screen inside the scanner bore
at a viewing distance of \unit[63]{cm}.
%
Stimulus images of the localizer paradigm were displayed at a size of
approximately \unit[10]$^{\circ}$ $\times$ \unit[10]$^{\circ}$ of visual angle.
%
Movie frames of the movie paradigm were displayed at a size of approximately
\unit[21.3]$^{\circ}$ $\times$ \unit[9.3]$^{\circ}$.
% AD
During the functional scans of the audio-description study, the projector
presented a medium gray screen with the primary purpose to illuminate a

\subsection{Preprocessing}

\todo[inline]{following phrasing is almost identical to PPA-Paper}

% data sources
The current analyses were carried out on the same preprocessed fMRI data
\citep{hanke2016aligned} that were used for the technical validation analysis
presented in \citet{hanke2016simultaneous}, the localization of higher-visual
areas \citep{sengupta2016extension}, and investigation of responses of the PPA
correlating with naturalistic spatial information \citep{sengupta2016extension}.
% exclusion of VP 10
Of those 15 participants in the studyforrest dataset that took part in all three
experiments, data of one participant were dropped due to invalid distortion
correction during scanning of the audio-description stimulus.
% preprocessing of pre-aligned data
Data were corrected for motion, aligned with and re-sliced onto a
participant-specific BOLD template image \citep{sengupta2016extension} (uniform
spatial resolution of \unit[2.5$\times$2.5$\times$2.5]{mm} for both
audio-description and movie data).

``We estimated the face-selectivity map for a participant from his or her own
localizer data by calculating the GLM univariate contrast map of faces vs. all
the other categories (e.g., body, place) for each run and averaging t-values
across the four maps'' \citep{jiahui2020predicting}.

``We estimated each participant’s face-selectivity map based on that
participant’s localizer data and based on other participants’ localizer data
projected into that participant’s cortical anatomy using hyperalignment and
anatomical surface alignment (see Fig. 1). We then calculated correlations
between the map based on a participant’s own data and the maps estimated from
other participants' data and compared these correlations to the reliability of
the participant's map, indexed with Cronbach's Alpha. We estimated the
face-selectivity map for a participant from his or her own localizer data by
calculating the GLM univariate contrast map of faces vs. all the other
categories (e.g., body, place) for each run and averaging t-values across the
four maps. We estimated a participant’s map from other participants’ data by
first projecting all other participants’ localizer data into that participant’s
cortical anatomy and calculating the GLM univariate contrast map of faces versus
all other categories for each run in each other participant then averaging
t-values across the maps (56 maps for studyforrest, 14 subjects x 4 runs for
each; 80 maps for Grand Budapest, 20 subjects x 4 runs each). We projected other
participants’ localizer data into each individual participant’s cortical anatomy
using hyperalignment with either direct projection or via the common model
space, as described above. We also estimated each participant's face-selectivity
map based on other participants’ anatomically aligned localizer data by simply
averaging across the maps based on anatomically-normalized data for each N-1 set
of 14 (studyforrest) or 20 (Grand Budapest) participants. Thus, the map
estimated from other participants' localizer data was a map of average t-values
across 56 or 80 maps (four runs per participant) for the contrast faces vs all.
The analysis pipeline was the same across conditions, and the only difference
was whether the N-1 participants' data were aligned to the left-out
participant's space using anatomical alignment, hyperalignment with direct
projection (1-step), or hyperalignment via the common model space (2-step). We
tested the quality of the maps estimated from other participants’ data by
calculating the correlation of each with the map estimated from a participant’s
own data. We also gauged the reliability of the estimates based on participants’
own data by calculating Cronbach's alpha based on variability across runs. To
examine local performance and reliability, we did the same analyses with
correlations between maps and Cronbach's Alpha in a searchlight analysis with a
radius of 15 mm. To test the applicability of our procedure to other
category-selective topographies, we extended our analyses to other contrasts
(scenes, bodies, and objects)'' \citep{jiahui2020predicting}.

\paragraph{Fitting of shared response model}

\todo[inline]{We assessed estimation performance using leave-one-subject-out
cross-validation: the model was trained on all-but-one subject and the held-out
subject was aligned to the fixed model to obtain his/her transformation matrix}

\todo[inline]{In the special case of SRM—which allows for calculating an
alignment from all provided subjects in a single decomposition—we with- held the
left-out subject from the shared response estimation step to avoid data leakage.
The projection of the left-out subject is then learnt from previously estimated
shared space. Finally, the learnt projections are applied to the decoding data,
and decoding is performed on the projected data'' \citep{bazeille2021empirical}}

\todo[inline]{mention that just 'ao \& av' as input were also tested?}

We used the probabilistic \ac{srm} algorithm implemented in BrainIAK v.11 (Brain
Imaging Analysis Kit, \citet{kumar2020brainiak, kumar2020brainiaktutorial},
http://brainiak.org) that spatial components to be orthonormal and $k\ll v$ (v
= voxel, t=time-points) to fit the \ac{srm}.
%
This implementation approximates the \ac{srm} using the Expectation Maximization
(EM) algorithm proposed by \citep{chen2015reduced} optimized by
\citet{anderson2016enabling}.
%
We followed a leave-one-subject-out folding scheme [correct term?]:
%
for every subject $n$, we used the other subjects' ($N-1$) concatenated fMRI
responses to the movie, audio-description, and functional localizer as training
set to compute the shared feature space.
%
Concatenated time series data were z-scored across experimental
paradigms.\todo{a second z-scoring}
% features
Considering the size of the ROIs the spatial resolution of the fMRI data, we
chose a value of $k=10$ for the number of features (i.e. the shared responses)
to be computed.
% n_iter
The number of iterations for the algorithm to minimize the error was set to 30
($n_{iter=10}$).

\todo[inline]{cf. \citep{haxby2011common} who ran PCA over ventral temporal
cortex and chose 35 dimensions; Figure 3; ``We show that the cortical
topographies associated with well-known category selectivities are preserved in
the 35-dimensional common model space}

\citep{haxby2020hyperalignment} on ventral temporal cortex: ``Principal
components analysis affords quantification of how much information in a dataset
can be accounted for by single dimensions. The first eigenvector is defined as
the axis along which variance is maximal, the second eigenvector is the
orthogonal axis along which the residual variance is maximal, and so forth.
Thus, PCA rotates the space to account for variance most efficiently, rather
than rotating the space to fit axes to a priori functional distinctions.
Applying PCA to the model space for ventral temporal cortex, developed based on
patterns of activity evoked by a naturalistic movie, revealed that approximately
35 principal components (PCs) were sufficient to account for the information
content of one hour of the movie, as indexed by bsMVPC (Haxby et al., 2011).
This PCA allows evaluation of the roles played by dimensions defined a priori by
functional distinctions relative to the information that is captured by the full
model in which both coarse-grained and fine-grained topographies can be modeled
as mixtures of topographic basis functions. Comparison of the topographies for
the top PCs with the topography for face versus object category selective areas
(Figure 8a), shows that this functional distinction does not emerge as one of
the top dimensions but only as a mixture of PCs (Figure 8a rightmost images),
raising the question of how large a role it plays in the functional topography
of ventral temporal cortex under naturalistic conditions''
\citep{haxby2020hyperalignment}.

``After hyperalignment, we reduced the dimensionality of the common space by
performing a principal components analysis (PCA) and deter- mined the subspace
that is sufficient to capture the full range of response-pattern distinctions''
\citep{haxby2011common}.

``We next asked how many dimensions are necessary to capture the information
that enables these high levels of BSC accuracy (Figure 1). We performed a
principal components analysis (PCA) of the mean responses to each movie time
point in common model space, averaging across subjects, then performed BSC of
the movie, face and object, and animal species data with varying numbers of top
principal components (PCs). The results show that BSC accuracies for all three
data sets continue to increase with more than 20 PCs (Figure 3A). We present
results for a common model space with 35 dimensions, which affords BSC
classification accuracies that are equivalent to BSC accuracies using all 1,000
original dimensions. The effect of number of PCs on BSC was similar for models
that were based only on Princeton (n = 10) or Dartmouth (n = 11) data,
suggesting that this estimate of dimensionality is robust across differences in
scanning hardware and scanning parameters (see Figure S3D)''
\citep{haxby2011common}.



``A lower-dimensional subspace is adequate to capture the distinctions among
response vectors. SVD of the movie data indicated that the information contained
in those data could be captured in a common model space with ~450 orthogonal
dimensions. In our initial report on a common model of VT cortex, whose volume
is ~10\% of all cortex, we found that ~35 dimensions were sufficient to capture
the movie information content contained in the fMRI data, as well as the
information in 2 category perception experiments. These dimensionality estimates
are a function of the spatial and temporal resolution of fMRI and the number and
variety of response vectors used to derive the common space. The true
dimensionality of representation in human cortex surely involves vastly more
distinct tuning functions. Estimates of the dimensionality of cortical
representation, therefore, will almost certainly be much higher as data with
higher spatial and temporal resolution for larger and more varied samples of
response vectors are used to build new common models''
\citep{guntupalli2016model}.



``In this paper, $k=10$ since low-rank SVD with 20 dimensions captures 90\% of
the variance of the original fMRI matrices \citep{chen2015reduced}. We also
experimented with using $k=5,20,30,40,50$, but the results barely varied from
using $k=10$ dimensions.  Note that, for testing, the learned $W_{i}$ allow us
to project unseen fMRI data into the shared space via $W_{i}^{T}X_{i}^{test}$
since $W_{i}$ has orthogonal columns'' \citep{vodrahalli2018mapping}.

%
During model fitting, the algorithm computes the shared feature space $S$ ($k$
features by $t$ time points) and calculates subject-specific, orthogonal [?]
transformation matrices $W_{n}$ ($v$ voxel by $k$ features).
%
These transformation matrices, or weight matrices, reflect the loadings of
voxels onto features [i.e. subject-specific functional topographies], and allow
to project responses of voxels within each subjects' \ac{roi}(s) from anatomical
space into the $k$-dimensional shared feature space, and thus functionally align
subjects.

\todo[inline]{negative control: I need to check the code; unfortunately, it is
still pretty early in the processing pipeline}

% shuffled data
As negative control, we shuffled the order of runs of audio-description and
movie (but not visual localizer) before fitting a shared response model to the
time series.

``The weight matrices that we created from SRM data are not only useful for
projecting new data into a shared space but also for the reverse —
reconstructing data in subject space''.

%
We then aligned each left-out subject to the shared space $S$ that was computed
from the other subjects' data.
%
The algorithm learns a mapping $W_{n}$ of the left-out subject's anatomical
space into the shared space $S$ that is kept fixed.
%
Critically, in order evaluate the relationship between the length of the
stimulus that is used to align an ``unknown'' subject to a preexisting shared
space and prediction performance, we performed a \textit{partial alignment}:
%
We used an increasing number of segments (1 up to 8) of the naturalistic stimuli
per subject to let the algorithm learn the orthogonal mapping to the TRs of the
corresponding segment(s) in the shared space.
%
As a result, we obtained 8 transformation matrices per subject and per
naturalistic stimulus.
%
Each matrix has a size of $v$ voxels by $k$ features but is based on a different
quantity of data used to calculate the mapping [i.e. subject-specific functional
topographies].


\subsection{Estimation of scene-selective topography}

\todo[inline]{in both following cases the mean was computed in subject-specific
anatomical space; I also tested creating a template by computing the mean in
shared feature space; leads to pretty similar; but I did not create a template
by taking the mean in MNI space; estimation using anatomy has always been mean
of z-maps in subject-space in both cases}


%
To predict the results of the functional localizer (statistical $Z$-maps
representing functional topographies) of a left-out subject, we projected all
other participants $Z$-maps from their subject-specific anatomy into the shared
feature space, and from the shared feature space into the left-out subject's
anatomy.
%
As a benchmark to evaluate the performance of the estimation using functional
alignment, we similarly estimated each left-out subject's $Z$-map using
volume-based anatomical alignment.


\subsubsection{Prediction/estimation using \ac{cms}}

\todo[inline]{terminology: it is NOT the "inverse" but "transpose" matrix}

%
First, individual results from the visual localizer [and auditory naturalistic
stimulus] were masked (in each individuals' subject-space) with the union of PPA
masks group PPA.
%
Then, data were transformed from subject-specific, anatomical spaces into the
shared response space [by calling srm.transform(masked\_zmaps)'].
%
Using the transpose of the left-out subject's transformation matrix, the
$Z$-maps were projected from shared response space into the anatomical space of
the left-out subject.
%
The mean of the 13 projected $Z$-maps served as an estimation of the left-out
subject empirical $Z$-map (s. \citep{sengupta2016extension})

\todo[inline]{check TNT github/gin repo; what is the corresponding paper?}

%
We also estimated each left-out subject's $Z$-map using volume-based anatomical
alignment.
% into MNI
First, we warped the results of the visual localizer from each subjects'
space(bold3Tp2) into MNI space (grpbold3Tp2) using precomputed transformation
matrices that are part of the studyforrest dataset [LINK; cf. method section in
PPA-Paper].
% into left-out subject
Then, results of all subjects were warped from MNI space in to the left-out
subject's space
%
The transformed $Z$-maps were masked with mask of unions of PPAs and the
individual's \ac{fov}.
%
Finally, the mean of these $Z$-maps served as a prediction of the corresponding
left-out subject's empirical $Z$-map.


\subsection{Quantifying the performance}


\subsubsection{Correlation stuff}

%
To quantify the performance of our estimations based on different number of runs
of the movie and audio-description, we calculated the Pearson's correlation
coefficients between the empirical $Z$-maps from the localizer experiment [and
audio-description] and estimated $Z$-map based on other subject's data.

%
Further we compared these correlations to the reliability [internal
consistency?] of visual localizer using Cronbach's Alpha based on the
variability across runs [as did
\citep{jiahui2020predicting}].

\subsection{backup: alternative template creation}
%
lastly, we currently apply another method to get the „z-map template“ on which
the prediction is based ('test/data\_denoise-vis.py';
'test/data\_srm-vis-to-ind.py')
%
From \citep{jiahui2020predicting} (an approach different from ours): ``We
estimated a participant's map from other participants' data by first projecting
all other participants' localizer data into that participant's cortical anatomy
and calculating the GLM univariate contrast map of faces versus all other
categories for each run in each other participant then averaging t-values across
the maps (56 maps for StudyForrest, 14 subjects x 4 runs for each; 80 maps for
Grand Budapest, 20 subjects x 4 runs each)'' \citep{jiahui2020predicting}.
%
``An added benefit is that SRM helps address the data starvation problem above:
because the SRM space is by definition shared across individuals, data from
multiple participants can be combined prior to MVPA or other analyses''
\citep{cohen2017computational}.

``Common model maps of category selectivity. To project category- selectivity
topographic maps based on other subjects into the cortical anatomy of a new
subject, we first transformed all subjects' data from the category-selective
localizer study into the common model space using the transformation matrices
derived from the full movie data. For each subject, the functional localizer
data from all other subjects were projected into that subject’s brain using the
transposes of individual transformation matrices derived from the full movie
data. These data were then smoothed with a 6 mm FWHM Gaussian filter and mapped
to the curvature- aligned cortical surface mesh. Category-selective t-statistic
maps were then computed for selectivity for faces, places, objects, and bodies
using 3dDeconvolve and 3dREMLﬁt in AFNI on surface nodes based on each subject’s
own data and, independently, on the data from other subjects in that subject’s
anatomical space. For comparison, similar category-selective t-statistic maps
also were calculated for each subject based on other subjects' data in the
curvature-aligned cortical surface mesh before hyperalignment, thereby using
only anatomical alignment. The similarity of category-selectivity maps
calculated from subjects’ own localizer data and from other subjects’ localizer
data was computed by calculating correlations (Pearson’s r) of the t-statistic
maps in a ventral visual pathway surface ROI that included VT and lateral
occipital cortices, testing the similarity of each individual to both the
hyperaligned and anatomically aligned data from other subjects''
\citep{guntupalli2016model}.

``We then contrasted the similarity of maps based on individual and other
subjects' data to the within-subject reliability of category-selective maps. We
estimated the within-subject reliability of the category-selectivity maps by
computing the correlation between t-statistic maps computed from odd and even
runs. To control for the effect of only using half of the localizer data, we
also computed the correlations between the t-statistic maps calculated from the
odd and the even runs in each subject and the maps calculated from other
subjects’ data and averaged these correlations after Fisher transformation. We
tested the significance of differences between correlations by calculating 95%
CI of these differences using bootstrapping (Kirby and Gerlanc
2013)\citep{guntupalli2016model}'' .

\paragraph{denoising}
%
``De-noised individual-subject data can be reconstructed by
projecting data from the reduced-dimension shared space back into any given
subject’s brain space'' \citep{kumar2020brainiak}.

%
``Transformations estimated from one subset of data can be used to project
unseen data into the shared space. Projecting data into shared space increases
both temporal and spatial ISC (by design), and in many cases improves
between-subject model performance to the level of within-subject performance''
\citep{kumar2020brainiak}.


\section{Results}

\subsection{Phrasing of results in other papers}

We correlated the whole-cortex contrast map (faces-vs-all) based on a
participant’s own data with the maps estimated from other participants’ data
separately for the StudyForrest and Grand Budapest datasets. After 1-step
hyperalignment, the mean Pearson correlation values across participants were
0.58 (StudyForrest, N = 15, S.D. = 0.08) and 0.69 (Grand Budapest, N = 21, S.D.
= 0.08) (Fig. 2).

Hyperalignment greatly improved the prediction performance compared with
anatomical surface alignment. With surface alignment, the average Pearson
correlation values across participants were 0.40 (N ¼ 15, S.D. ¼ 0.08) and 0.50
(N ¼ 21, S.D. ¼ 0.06) in the StudyForrest and Grand Budapest datasets,
respectively (Fig. 3). The difference between the hyperaligned and the
surface-aligned mean correlation values was highly significant (StudyForrest:
t(14) = 17.39, p < 0.001; Grand Budapest: t(20) = 25.49, p < 0.001).

We also estimated each participant’s topography with the 2-step hyperalignment
algorithm that projects other participants’ localizer data into a common model
information space then uses the transpose of the target participant’s
transformation matrix to project other participants’ data from the common model
space into his or her cortical anatomy. With this 2-step method, we found
similar but slightly weaker results. The mean Pearson correlation values between
face-selectivity maps based on a participant’s own localizer data and the
predicted map after hyperalignment were 0.55 (StudyForrest, N = 15, S.D. = 0.08)
and 0.67 (Grand Budapest, N = 21, S.D. = 0.08). These correlations after
hyperalignment were significantly better than the correlations after surface
alignment (StudyForrest: t(14) = 15.78, p < 0.001; Grand Budapest: t(20) =
16.61, p < 0.001), but the estimates with the 1-step procedure were
significantly better than estimates with the 2-step procedure (StudyForrest:
t(14) = 11.30, p < 0.001; Grand Budapest: t(20) = 6.98, p < 0.001).

all from \citep{jiahui2020predicting}: ``We compared the correlations between
maps estimated from a participant's own data and maps estimated from other
participants' data to the reliability of the localizer. We computed the
reliability of the contrast maps with Cronbach's Alpha based on variability
across the four localizer runs for each set. The mean Cronbach's Alpha between
the four localizer runs was 0.60 (N = 15, S.D. = 0.14) in the StudyForrest
dataset [...](Fig. 2)''.
%
``These results mean that if we scan each participant for another 4 localizer
runs, and compute the correlation between the two maps (4 runs vs. 4 runs), the
correlation would be 0.60 on average in the StudyForrest''.
%
``Cronbach's alpha indicates that the predicted contrast map based on
hyperalignment is close to or as good as the real contrast map based on four
localizer runs (StudyForrest: t(14) = 0.61, p = 0.55; Grand Budapest: t(20) =
3.02, p = 0.007)''.
%
``In the StudyForrest dataset, the predicted contrast map based on
hyperalignment was better than the contrast map based on data from three out of
four localizer runs in other participants (t(14) = 2.36, p = 0.03) and in Grand
Budapest, the predicted contrast map was comparable to the contrast map based on
three localizer runs in other participants (t(20) = 0.48, p = 0.63)''.

``A scatterplot of the individual correlation values with hyperalignment and

\section{Discussion}


\subsection{Short Summary}

\subsubsection{Aim}

\subsubsection{Methods}

\subsubsection{Results}


\subsection{Discussion of current results}


We have cross-subject, cross-experiment, and cross-scanner prediction


AV \& VIS are from the same scanner, if not same session?

\subsubsection{Model Space}
%
Results indicate that we are able to use multiple subjects to learn a
10-dimensional shared space for the fMRI data that increases performance on our
experiments.

%
Asymptotic ``performance curve'' might be different for another brain region
(temporal receptive fields?).
%
What about rentinotopic mapping?
%
What about ``higher'' cognition?
%
What about executive functions?


\subsubsection{Partial Alignment}
%
15 min of movie watching used for functional alignment outperform prediction
using anatomical alignment
%
30 minutes of movie watching outperform 15 minutes of movie watching
%
more than 30 minutes do not lead to a significantly improved prediction
performance.


\paragraph{what partial alignment might be good for}
%
Reduced costs.
%
There is a benefit of shared parts of naturalistic stimuli across datasets;
shared stimulus part is easier than shared subjects (e.g.
\citep{zhang2018transfer}).


\subsubsection{Audio PPA}

%
Response in PPA during AO might be different.
%
There are some subjects which do not have a AO PPA 'cause they just do not give
a shit about spatial information in AO? Might be an issue of missing task?


``Notwithstanding their non-conformation to a theoretically universal map of the
brain, such topological outliers, if they do not result from artefacts, can also
be considered to be interesting cases of inter-individual variability to
understand brain–phenotype relationships [98].Indeed, recent studies have
suggested that the topography (location and size) of individual-specific brain
parcellations is predictive of individual differences in demographics,
cognition, emotion and personality [3,5,99]. In this context, we would argue
that the quest to under- stand robust patterns of brain topography across
different markers and the investigation of inter-individual differences are
closely intertwined challenges. Only by understanding the generic characteristic
of topographic organization can we start to appreciate idiosyncrasies and their
relationships to socio-demographic, cognitive or affective profiles''
\citep{eickhoff2018imaging}.

\subsection{Self-critique \& short comings}


\subsubsection{sample size}

``Most studies that use small samples are likely to exhibit highly variable
estimates. This finding suggests that many of the claims of predictive accuracy
in the neuroimaging literature may be exaggerated and/or not valid''
\citep{poldrack2019establishment}.


\subsubsection{localizer is ``ground truth''}

%
``The dynamic localizer (in Grand Budapest data set) was significantly more
reliable than the static localizer (in StudyForrest data set) (t(34) = 3.76, p <
0.001) despite its shorter length (four 234s runs versus four 312s runs,
respectively)'' \citep{jiahui2020predicting}.

%
From \citep{weiner2018defining}: ``the identification of the PPA is complicated
by (at least) four methodological considerations. First, the PPA definition may
depend on the type of experiment, task, and stimuli used. Second, the boundaries
of the PPA may depend on the statistical threshold used. Third, the spatial
extent and localization of the PPA may vary if defined within the native brain
space of an individual or based on a group analysis. Fourth, the size of the PPA
may depend on data acquisition choices (e.g. large vs. small voxels) and data
analysis choices (e.g. liberal smoothing vs. no spatial smoothing). The present
study aims to identify and to predict the most probable location of
place-selective voxels within medial VTC of an individual brain that is
impervious to these methodological decisions'' \citep{weiner2018defining}.

%
\citet{lilienfeld2015fifty} on ``gold standard'': ``In the domains of
psychological and psychiatric assessment, there are precious few, if any,
genuine ``gold standards''. Essentially all measures, even those with high
levels of validity for their intended purposes, are necessarily fallible
indicators of their respective constructs [Cronbach and Meehl, 1955; Faraone and
Tsuang, 1994]. As a consequence, the widespread practice referring to even
well-validated measures of personality or psychopathology, such as Hare’s
(1991/2003) Psychopathy Checklist-Revised, as ``gold standards'' for their
respective constructs [Ermer et al., 2012] is misleading [see Skeem and Cooke,
2010]. If authors intend to refer to measures as ``extensively validated'', they
should simply do so'' \citep{lilienfeld2015fifty}

%
\citet{scheinost2019ten} in context of phenotypic measures: ``Predictive models
based on neuroimaging data will only ever account for a fraction of the
variance. Neuroimaging studies are limited by how much information the signal
can capture about the measure of interest. At the same time, these studies are
also limited by the chosen phenotypic measure used.  While the success of a
model is evaluated by how well it predicts a phenotypic measure (and these
phenotypic measures have to be treated as gold standards), it is well known that
such measures are not always the ground truth but themselves suffer from
confounds and noise.  When studying brain-behavior associations, one must keep
in mind how extraordinary it is that neuroimaging data can be distilled to
approximate phenotypic measures that reflect a simplification of multiple
complex features. Thus, even modest results are reasonable and remarkable. For a
discussion on the reliability of phenotypic measures in the context of
predictive modeling, we point the interested reader to: [Dubois et al., 2018a,
2018b; Gignac and Bates, 2017]'' \citep{scheinost2019ten}.


\subsubsection{ROI creation procedure}

we have a little leakage of test data; especially at the borders of the ROI we
might "miss" some voxels cause the ROIS is based on thresholded mask (performing
com cutting on the edges).

\todo[inline]{check paper regarding ``probabilistic functional atlases''}


\subsubsection{Volume-based registration vs. surface-based normalization}

%
Sengupta did the published analyses $Z$-maps in volume space
%
I could have run the analyses/contrasts on the surface but opportunity costs.
%
\todo[inline]{Volumen-based anatomical alignment was compared to volume-based
functional alignment}

Volume vs. surface: e.g. \citep{desai2005volumetric}

\citep{weiner2018defining} compares cortex-based alignment
\citep{fischl1999high} with volume-based (Talairach) alignment: ``we repeated
our leave-one-out cross-validation procedure across all 24 participants with an
affine volume-based registration to the Talairach brain and compared this
performance to the same procedure implemented with CBA in FreeSurfer
\citep{weiner2018defining}''




\subsection{Future questions}

\subsubsection{Predict other t-contrasts of higher-visual area localizer}


\paragraph{Predict other functional areas / other localizers}


e.g. retinotopy, language areas

%
Again, data from the studyforrest project will be used to perform assessments
analog to WP1e for a range of additional individually determined regions based
on established localizer paradigms (Sengupta, et al., 2016).
%
These regions include: the \ac{ffa}, \ac{ppa}, and \ac{eba}  which are
associated with face perception \citep{kanwisher1997ffa,
pitcher2011occipitalfacearea}, scene perception \citep{epstein1998ppa}, and the
perception of human bodies \citep{downing2001bodyarea}, respectively.

``First, our brains directly process exogenous information about the external
environment by transducing physical phenomena (e.g., changes in energy,
molecular concentrations, etc.) into sensory perceptions that allow us to
generate and maintain a sense of what is happening around us (1, 2). Mental
representations that are directly driven by the external world are likely to be
highly similar across individuals who share the same sensory experience. Second,
our brains also process endogenous information that reflects our current
internal homeostatic states, past experiences, and future goals (3). The
integration of exogenous and endogenous informa- tion allows us to meaningfully
interpret our surroundings, prioritize information that is relevant to our
goals, and develop action plans (4). Given the same input information,
individuals may have unique interpretations, feelings, and plans, often leading
endogenous rep- resentations to be idiosyncratic across individuals''
\citep{chang2021endogenous}.

``Human brains have much in common with one another. Similarities exist not only
at the anatomical level, but also in terms of functional organization. Given the
same stimulus—an expanding ring, for example—regions of the brain that process
sensory (visual) stimuli will respond in a highly predictable and similar manner
across differ- ent individuals. This predictability is not limited to sensory
systems: shared activity across people has also been observed in higher-order
brain regions (for example, the default mode network6, or DMN) dur- ing the
processing of semantically complex real-life stimuli such as movies and
stories7–13. Notably, shared responses in these high-order areas seem to be
associated with narrative content and not with the physical form used to convey
it11,14,15. It is unknown, at any level of the cortical hierarchy, to what
extent the similarity of human brains during shared perception is recapitulated
during shared recollection. This prospect is made especially challenging when
recall is spontane- ous and spoken, and the selection of details is left up to
the remem- berer (rather than the experimenter), as is often the case in real
life'' \citep{chen2017shared}.



\subsubsection{Create CMS from other study}

\todo[inline]{a.k.a. ``more subjects''}
%
Create a CMS from another experiment's data,
using another scanner and hopefully more subjects
%
In case of an alignment of time series,
that experiment needs, at least, a part of Forrest Gump as an intersection


\subsubsection{Other functional alignment algorithms}

\todo[inline]{cf. \citep{bazeille2021empirical}}

\todo[inline]{Multimodal Surface Matching (Robinson et al. 2014)?}

``As we use inter-subject decoding to compare functional alignment methods, we
only consider methods that meet the following two criteria. First, the alignment
transformations should be learned on activations evoked during temporally
synchronized (i.e., co-occuring) task data, or on contrasts matched across
individuals. Second, the learned transformations must be invertible or almost
invertible linear mappings and applicable as-is on unseen data with a different
task structure. These two criteria exclude several methods currently used in the
literature such as regularized canonical correlation analysis (rCCA; Bilenko and
Gallant, 2016), gradient hyperalignment (Xu et al., 2018), connectivity
hyperalignment (Guntupalli et al., 2018), and methods based on Laplacian
embeddings (Langs et al., 2014)'' \citep{bazeille2021empirical}.

``Nonetheless, it remains unclear how researchers should choose among the
available functional alignment methods for a given research application''
\citep{bazeille2021empirical}.


\subsubsection{ROI vs. searchlight}

\todo[inline]{searchlight SRM \citep{zhang2016searchlight}}

\todo[inline]{Hyperalignment searchlight paper?}

%
Our union of PPA is XX voxels big.
%
Influence of voxel count on performance; take searchlight (but how big should it
be?

% Guntupalli's searchlight paper
Later, \citet{guntupalli2016model} showed that hyperalignment can be extended to
predict functional organization across large proportions of the cortical
surface, for example to predict the represented visual field coordinate in
visual cortex based on retinotopic mapping scans of other individuals.

``Applying SRM to a large swath of the brain means that all voxels within the
region contribute to the final derived metric. This can conflict with the goal
of associating spatially local activity with specific cognitive functions. To
address such issues, SRM can be applied in small overlapping searchlights to
obtain localized metrics of shared information [71,99]
\citep{cohen2017computational}''.

``As piecewise alignment is learned within a parcellation, an important question
is: which brain atlas should be used for piecewise alignment? In Supplementary
Figure S2 we compare results from the Schaefer et al. (2018) atlases to those
from parcellations derived directly on the alignment data. By default, the
results presented piecewise alignment is learned within a parcellation, an
important question is: which brain atlas should be used for piecewise alignment?
In Supplementary Figure S2 we compare results from the Schaefer et al. (2018)
atlases to those from parcellations derived directly on the alignment data. By
default, the results presented below are derived with the 300 ROI parcellation
of the Schaefer atlas unless noted otherwise. In the case of searchlight
Procrustes, we selected searchlight parameters to match those used in Guntupalli
et al. (2016); that is, each searchlight had 5 voxel radius, with a 3 voxel
distance between search- light centers. All searchlight analyses were
implemented using PyMVPA [Hanke et al., 2009].ted below are derived with the 300
ROI parcellation of the Schaefer atlas unless noted otherwise. In the case of
searchlight Procrustes, we selected searchlight parameters to match those used
in Guntupalli et al. (2016); that is, each searchlight had 5 voxel radius, with
a 3 voxel distance between search- light centers. All searchlight analyses were
implemented using PyMVPA (Hanke et al., 2009)'' \citep{bazeille2021empirical}.

``An alternative scheme, piecewise alignment (Bazeille et al., 2019), uses
non-overlapping neighborhoods either learnt from the data using a parcellation
method—such as k-means—or derived from an a priori functional or anatomical
atlas. Local transforms are derived in each neighborhood and concatenated to
yield a single large-scale transformation. Unlike searchlight, this returns a
transformation matrix with the desired regularities. This framework might induce
staircase effects or other functionally-irrelevant discontinuities in the final
transformation due to the underlying boundaries'' \citep{bazeille2021empirical}.

``To align the entire cortex across subjects, two main frameworks have been
proposed: searchlight and piecewise aggregation schemes. Each of these
frameworks use functional alignment methods to learn local transformations and
aggregate them into a single large-scale alignment; however, search- light and
piecewise differ in how they aggregate transforms, as illustrated in Figure 2.
The searchlight scheme [Kriegeskorte et al., 2006], popular in brain imaging
[Guntupalli et al., 2018; 2016], has been used as a way to divide the cortex
into small overlapping spheres of a fied radius. This method allows researchers
to remain agnostic as to the lo- cation of functional or anatomical boundaries,
such as those suggested by parcellation-based approaches. A local transform can
then be learnt in each sphere and the full alignment is obtained by aggregating
[e.g. summing as in Guntupalli et al., 2016 or averaging] across overlapping
transforms. Importantly, the aggregated transformation produced is no longer
guaranteed to bear the type of regularity (e.g orthogonality, isometry, or
diffeomorphicity enforced during the local neighborhood fit''
\citep{bazeille2021empirical}.


\subsubsection{Time series vs connectivity-based}

\todo[inline]{kind of a killer cause you do not need intersection of
time series; but s. Guntupalli's paper: time series hyperalignment outperforms
connectivity-based hyperalignment (?)}

%
``Hyperalignment models shared information that is embedded in idiosyncratic
cortical patterns across brains. Modeling shared information makes it possible
to compare functional anatomy across brains at a fine spatial scale.
Hyperalignment projects cortical pattern vectors into a common, high-dimensional
information space [Haxby et al., 2020]. Derivation of this common space can be
based on either neural response profiles (e.g. data collected during tasks, such
as movie viewing (Haxby et al., 2011)) or functional connectivity profiles files
[Guntupalli et al., 2018]'' \citep{busch2021hybrid}.

%
``Results showed that both CHA and RHA increased ISCs and bsMVPC classification
accuracies significantly over anatomy-based alignment, but each algorithm
achieves better alignment for the information that it uses to derive a common
model, namely connectivity profiles and patterns of response, respectively. ISCs
of connectivity profiles are significantly higher in a common model based on CHA
than in a common model based on RHA (ROI mean ISCs = 0.67 and 0.575,
respectively; CHA-RHA difference = 0.095 [0.081, 0.112])(S1 Fig). By contrast,
RHA marginally but significantly outperforms CHA on some validations based on
response tuning functions, namely ISCs of representational geometry (ROI means =

% from project proposal
From project proposal: ``In his doctoral thesis, recently submitted to the
Faculty of Natural Sciences in Magdeburg, Falko Kaule showed that congruent
time-locked BOLD responses across subjects (i.e. all subjects watching the exact
same full-length movie) as used by Haxby and colleagues are not required to
derive a valid alignment of individuals with a common representational space
\citep{kaule2017examination}.
%
Comparable prediction performance can be achieved by using \textbf{functional
connectivity patterns} (correlation of a voxel's time series with reference
regions in the same brain)'' (s. dissertation project proposal).
%
It should be noted that the number of voxels that can be considered
simultaneously for functional BOLD response time series alignment is limited by
the number of timepoints in the calibration scan (about 300-400 voxels for a
15min scan with a 2s TR, corresponding to a local cortical neighborhood of about
1cm in diameter for a standard resolution).
%
This limitation does not exist in this form for a functional alignment that is
based on connectivity vectors.
%
The length of these connectivity vectors is determined by the number of
reference (or seed) regions in the brain.

\todo[inline]{wtf did \citep{nastase2019leveraging} do?}

% Nastase's ugly mofo paper
``Finally, estimating the SRM from functional connectivity
data rather than response time series circumvents the need for a single shared
stimulus across subjects; connectivity SRM allows us to derive a single shared
response space across different stimuli with a shared connectivity profile
\citep{nastase2019leveraging}'' \citep{kumar2020brainiak}.


\subsubsection{Individual residuals?}

\todo[inline]{We have transformation matrices for individual mapping; but just
onto shared responses}

%
``Furthermore, in cases where each subject's unique response is of more interest
than the shared signal, SRM can be used to factor out the shared component
thereby isolating the idiosyncratic response for each subject [13]''
\citep{kumar2020brainiak}.

From \citep{cohen2017computational}: ``The flip side of focusing on shared
responses is to focus on responses that are idiosyncratic to individuals.
Although these responses are excluded in SRM, they are not necessarily noise and
may in fact be highly reliable within participants.  SRM can be used to isolate
participant-unique responses by examining the residuals after removing shared
group responses, or it can be applied hierarchically to the residuals to
identify subgroups \citep{chen2017shared} \citep{cohen2017computational} [this
other ``Chen'' is fucking up the aethestics of references].  More generally,
there is a growing trend toward investigating individual differences as another
source of meaningful variance in fMRI [73].  Recognizing that signal exists
beyond the average or shared response of a group, such studies exploit
idiosyncratic but stable responses to account for previously unexplained
variance in brain function, behavioral performance and clinical measures
[70,74]'' \citep{cohen2017computational}.

\subsubsection{Multiple localizer}

``Calibration scan'' to align to \ac{cms} and atlas of reference group.
%
From project proposal: ``Once a valid alignment is established, known functional
properties of a (normative) reference, derived from extensive scans and analysis
of other subjects, can then be projected into the respective individual voxel
space (s.  Fig. 1 in \citep{nishimoto2016lining})''.

%
``Movies engage multiple brain systems in parallel. From a single movie dataset
multiple functional topographies can be estimated [Guntupalli et al., 2016],
whereas different localizers are typically required to map different functional
topographies, making a thorough mapping of selective topographies time-consuming
and inefficient'' \citep{jiahui2020predicting}.

\todo[inline]{cf. general introduction}

\paragraph{Validity \& generalizability}

\todo[inline]{generalizability: scan once, estimate many}
% from project proposal
Naturalistic stimuli promise an ``increased validity of derived transformation
for functional alignment by sampling a more diverse set of mental states that
reflect (confound) statistics of the natural environment, and enable
investigation of the acquired data for a variety of research questions (e.g.
visual or auditory perception, spatial cognition; emotion; music, speech or
social perception)'' [project proposal].

% from Haxby 2020
``Estimating the parameters to transform high-dimensional spaces from individual
brains into a common high-dimensional space requires a rich set of data that
samples a wide variety of cortical patterns in order to generalize to novel
stimuli or tasks. For response hyperalignment, a rich variety of stimuli or
conditions are necessary to sample the response vector space. For connectivity
hyperalignment, the sampling of connectivity vector space is defined by the
selection of connectivity targets, but the richness and reliability of
connectivity estimates depends on the variety of brain states over which
connectivity is estimated'' \citep{haxby2020hyperalignment}.


\paragraph{additional benefit: compliance}
%
``As a rule of thumb, SRM will improve sensitivity for detecting a cognitive
process of interest in the test data if the training stimuli or trials strongly
and variably engage that process in a way that is reliable across participants''
\citep{cohen2017computational}.

%
``Movies are more engaging and result in better compliance
\citep{vanderwal2015inscapes}. Movie viewing can also be used in subject
populations, such as children \citep{richardson2018development} or patients,
that may have trouble maintaining attention during repetitions of a tedious
localizer task'' \citep{jiahui2020predicting}.

%
``Movies engage multiple brain systems in parallel. From a single movie dataset
multiple functional topographies can be estimated (Guntupalli et al., 2016),
whereas different localizers are typically required to map different functional
topographies, making a thorough mapping of selective topographies
time-consuming and inefficient. Movies also simulate better the statistics of
natural viewing and listening and may provide more ecologically valid maps.
Analogously, the introduction of dynamic videos of faces and control categories
to localize face-selective topographies provides more reliable maps and better
estimate the extent of face-selective regions than do localizers with still
image stimuli (Fox et al., 2009; Pitcher et al., 2011). Similarly, naturalistic
stimuli may better sample the full range of responses to faces and other stimuli
that contribute to face-selective topographies'' \citep{jiahui2020predicting}.

\paragraph{in general}

Last paragraph of \citet{jiahui2020predicting}'s introduction: ``These results
lay a foundation for building a computational tool with a database that could
allow others to map multiple functional topographies in new subjects using only
data collected during movie viewing. Functional localizers are inefficient
because they only estimate one or a few topographies for each localizer. Movies,
by contrast, engage in parallel multiple neural systems for vision, audition,
language, person perception, social cognition, and other functions.
Consequently, movies have the potential to estimate selective topographies in
all of these do- mains. Such a tool would require a database of data for movies
and a range of functional localizers in a normative group of subjects. A new
subject’s functional topographies could be estimated based only on that
subject’s movie data and other subjects’ localizer data from the normative
database that could be projected into that subject’s cortical anatomy using
hyperalignment transformation matrices derived from movie data. Such a resource
would be more efficient and replace tedious functional localizers with an
engaging movie and could enable mapping of multiple functional topographies with
data from a single fMRI using a naturalistic stimulus''
\citet{jiahui2020predicting}.

``The algorithm also can be applied to simpler, con- trolled experimental data,
but our previous results showed that the sampling of response vectors from these
experiments is impoverished and produces a model representational space that
does not generalize well to new stimuli in other experiments (Haxby et al.
2011). Results show that the computational principles underlying this common
model have broad general validity for representational spaces in occipital,
temporal, parietal, and frontal cortices'' \citep{guntupalli2016model}.



\subsubsection{Functional atlas}

\todo[inline]{see also \citep{bazeille2019local}; who is quoting him?}


%
``While the functional alignment can also be applied to fMRI data from
stimulation paradigms with simplified stimuli, the transformations for
functional alignment have greatly diminished general validity
\citep{haxby2011common}, presumably because such experiments sample a sparser
range of brain states \citep{guntupalli2016model}'' [project proposal].

%
Moreover, naturalistic stimuli sample a broader range of brain states paradigms
with simplified stimuli \citep{guntupalli2016model, haxby2011common} promising
an increased validity of transformations of functional alignment and increased
generalizability to [research questions/domains/paradigms].

%
Naturalistic stimuli promise an ``increased validity of derived transformation
for functional alignment by sampling a more diverse set of mental states that
reflect (confound) statistics of the natural environment, and enable
investigation of the acquired data for a variety of research questions (e.g.
visual or auditory perception, spatial cognition; emotion; music, speech or
social perception)'' [project proposal].

``This result suggests that the validity for a model of a specific subspace may
be enhanced by designing a stimulus paradigm that samples the brain states in
that subspace more extensively'' \citep{haxby2011common}.

``hyperalignment of data using a set of stimuli that is less diverse than the
movie is effective, but the resultant common space has validity that is limited
to a small subspace of the representational space in VT cortex''
\citep{haxby2011common}.

``Initially, the common space produced with hyperalignment has the same number
of dimensions as the number of voxels in each individual’s native space. We
asked how many distinct common response-tuning functions are needed to contain
the information that affords the full range of fine-grained distinctions among
complex, visual stimuli. We tested the sufficiency of lower-dimensional
subspaces and found that BSC accuracies continued to increase with more than 20
common response- tuning functions. We present a 35-dimensional common model
space that afforded BSC for all three experiments at levels of accuracy that
were equivalent to BSC with all 1,000 hyperaligned dimensions or WSC with 1,000
voxels. Ten dimensions were sufficient within the limited stimulus domains of
each category perception experiment, but these sets of ten dimensions did not
afford high levels of BSC for the other experiment or for the movie. Thus, these
lower-dimensional models are subspaces of the full model and are valid only for
more limited stimulus domains'' \citep{haxby2011common}.


``Estimating the parameters to transform high-dimensional spaces from individual
brains into a common high-dimensional space requires a rich set of data that
samples a wide variety of cortical patterns in order to generalize to novel
stimuli or tasks. For response hyperalignment, a rich variety of stimuli or
conditions are necessary to sample the response vector space. For connectivity
hyperalignment, the sampling of connectivity vector space is defined by the

connectivity estimates depends on the variety of brain states over which
connectivity is estimated'' \citep{haxby2020hyperalignment}.

%
From project proposal: ``Moreover, beyond the scope of this project the targeted
homogenization of acquisition procedures will further the goal of large scale
data collection for the purpose of producing a normative reference of brain
function as measured by fMRI''.

%
From project proposal: ``The availability of such a reference would enable
quantitative and qualitative description of an individual's brain function with
respect to such a norm, and consequently progress the field towards neuroimaging
studies of individual differences that more closely resemble their psychological
counterparts''.

%
From talk at INM-7 seminar: ``Imagine you scan a new, unknown subject for just
15 minutes more, and you additionally get results from a whole variety of other
paradigms mapped onto that brain: results from localizers of low-level
perceptual processes, but also higher-level cognitive processes like language,
memory, emotions and so on. And kinda ``adventurous'': If you have different
common model spaces for different subgroups, you can investigate which alignment
onto which ``subgroup common model space'' results in less error, that lets you
classify to which subgroup your new subject might belong''.

%
From \citep{jiahui2020predicting}: ``results lay a foundation for building a
computational tool with a database that could allow others to map multiple
functional topographies in new subjects using only data collected during movie
viewing. Functional localizers are inefficient because they only estimate one or

data. Such a resource would be more efficient and replace tedious functional
localizers with an engaging movie and could enable mapping of multiple
functional topographies with data from a single fMRI using a naturalistic
stimulus'' \citep{jiahui2020predicting}.

``Characterizing this functional variability, particularly when considering the
genetic level, ideally requires acquiring functional imaging data from hundreds
of sub- jects and organizing these data into a large-scale database, together
with genetic, behavioral and biomorphological data. Databasing and analysis of
structural magnetic reso- nance images has already resulted in probabilistic
ana- tomical atlases [Toga, 2001, Probabilistic approaches; Van Essen, 2002,
Windows on the brain]. However, a similar large scale description of
functional networks is still lacking'' \citep{pinel2007fast}.
