%
Brain imaging using with \ac{fmri} of \ac{bold} activity has been used
extensively for almost three decades to investigate perceptual and cognitive
brain functions.
%
Human brain mapping (or \textit{topographic brain mapping}) maps brain functions,
perceptual or cognitive processes, onto the anatomy of the brain.
%
Typical analysis procedures average (voxel-wise) data of at least 10-15
subjects to improve the \ac{snr}.
%
Consequently, studies employing an averaging approach do not characterize brain
function at the level of an individual because these models that do not capture
individual brain properties but just a ``common denominator''
\citep{dubois2016building}. \todo{check paper}
%
However, characterization of individual brain function is by far the most
important application of BOLD fMRI in a clinical context.
%
For example, for a diagnosis of brain functions in health and disease, or
pre-surgical screening.
%
This dissertation explores weather naturalistic stimuli, here a Hollywood movie
and and its audio-only variant created for a visually impaired audience, could,
in principle, substitute a traditional, task-based paradigm to identify the
location, size, and shape of a functional area in the brain of individual
subjects.

% a.k.a. "state of research"


\todo[inline]{maybe define ecological \& external validity here already;
not in section about naturalistic stimuli later}

\todo[inline]{get a better definition of functional areas \& localization}

% definition
Studies subdivided the cerebral cortex into distinctive functional areas whose
statistically increased \ac{bold} activity is correlated with one particular
stimulus type.
% group level
On a group average level, previous studies presented isolated higher-level
visual categories such as pictures of scenes, faces, human bodies or tools.
%results from group average studies
Results suggest that category-specific brain regions like the \ac{ppa}
\citep{epstein1998ppa}, \ac{ffa} \citep{kanwisher1997ffa}), the occipital face
area \ac{ofa} \citep{pitcher2011occipitalfacearea}, the \ac{eba}
\citep{downing2001bodyarea}), and the \ac{loc} \citet{malach1995loc} exist in
the human brain.
% individual level: localizers
On the level of individual subjects, the most frequently employed paradigm to
characterize location, size, and shape of function areas with BOLD fMRI are
[grammar?] \textit{functional localizers}.
% localizers: definition
Functional localizers are dedicated measurement that aim at isolating and
localizing brain activity correlated with specific perceptual processes (e.g.
different object categories; \citet{kanwisher1997ffa}) or cognitive processes
(e.g. theory of mind; \citet{spunt2014validating}).
% purpose: ROI
Functional localizers can be used to define an subject-specific \acp{roi} to
improve the statistical power of the main experiment's analysis, or to locate
brain functions prior to neurosurgery.
% purpose: neurosurgery
Surgical procedures might impact the post-operative quality of life so much
(e.g. concerning cognitive control or speech production) that it potentially
outweighs the therapeutic benefits.
% efficiency
The challenge is to precisely localize relevant brain areas with limited
resources (time, availability and applicability of diagnostic measures for an
individual patient).
% one localizer = one domain of functions
Importantly, one dedicated localizer paradigm can only map one domain of brain
functions (e.g. retinotopic mapping, higher-visual perception
\citet{kanwisher1997ffa}, or speech perception
\citet{fernandez2001language}).\todo{other localizer papers?}
% fucking inefficient
Hence, functional localizers, despite [or because] being tuned for detection
power by employing carefully chosen and tightly-controlled, simplified stimuli,
quickly become inefficient if one wants to map many different processes in a
limited amount of time.
% localizer batteries: intro
Researchers have tried to tackle this issue by creating time-efficient
multi-functional \textit{localizer batteries} \citep{pinel2007fast,
pinho2018individual, pinho2020individual}. \todo{others? H.B.Project?}
% localizer batteries: example
For example, \citet{pinel2007fast} employs a range of dedicated stimuli and
specific tasks participants have to perform in a 5-minute routine.\todo{which
domains?}
% task based = shit
Nevertheless, the diagnostic quality of localizer batteries relies heavily on
participants' comprehension of the task instruction and their compliance, a
criterion that can be difficult to meet in clinical or pediatric populations
\citep{eickhoff2020towards, vanderwal2015inscapes, vanderwal2019movies}.
% validity?
Additionally, localizer batteries also rely on carefully chosen and
tightly-controlled, simplified stimuli that are usually presented in blocks do
not resemble how we perceive the real-world during every-day life leading to
questionable external and ecologically validity.\todo{add references}

% interim summary
In summary, we have two issues: a) validity and compliance, and b) efficiency.
% foreshadowing to next sections & transition to naturalistic stimuli
This dissertation will explore how we can both increase validity by using
\textit{naturalistic stimulus} paradigms as well as increase efficiency by
predicting individual functional topography from data collected in a reference
group.


\section{Naturalistic stimuli}

Ultimately, a major goal of cognitive neuroscience is to reveal how the brain
processes information during everyday perception.
%
Given the questionable/debatable ecological validity of traditional functional
localizer paradigms, it is often unclear how functional areas behave in
life-like situations and how they might interact.
%
After all, we do not experience the world around us as separated into small
unidimensional stimuli, but perceive --- through different senses --- a
seemingly continuous and unified world.
%
To address this open question, \textit{naturalistic stimuli} gained popularity
in neuroscience to investigate brain activity under more life-like conditions.


\paragraph{Definition}

% definition quote
Naturalistic stimuli are ``a class of stimuli that aim to evoke more
naturalistic patterns of neural responses than traditional controlled artificial
stimuli. Naturalistic paradigms are typically complex and dynamic, and longer in
duration than many conventional stimuli.'' \citep{vanderwal2019movies}.
%
They ``[Movies] sample a broad range of brain states and engage multiple
perceptual and cognitive systems in parallel'' \citep{haxby2020naturalistic}.
% movies & narratives
The most popular naturalistic stimuli in neuroscience are movies and audio-only
stories that provide time-locked event structure during a continuous,
complex/rich, dynamic, and often prolonged stimulation.


\paragraph{Ecological validity}
% definition
<Definition here>.
% claim; is KINDA QUOTE OF Haxby 2020?
Naturalistic stimuli promise a higher ecological validity \citep{zaki2009need,
hasson2012future, hamilton2018revolution} because they, despite being presented
in a laboratory setting, still more closely mimic the richness of real-life
visual and auditory experiences \citep{hasson2008neurocinematics,
haxby2020naturalistic}.

\paragraph{External validity}
% definition
<Definition here>.
% less selection bias
Carefully chosen stimulus sets ``selectively sample from the stimulus population
leading to a stimulus-as-fixed-effect fallacy [Clarc, The
language-as-fixed-effect fallacy: A critique of language statistics in
psychological research]'' \citep{westfall2016fixing}.
%
``The conclusions cannot be generalized to a broader population of stimuli
without risking inflated Type I error  [cf. Donnet S, Lavielle M, Poline JB: Are
fMRI event-related response constant in time? A model selection
answer]'' \citep{westfall2016fixing}.
%
Naturalistic stimuli promise a higher ecological validity because they draw a
more representative sample from the ``theoretical population of stimuli that
might have been used'' \citep{westfall2016fixing}.


\paragraph{Early findings}
% reviews
Audio-visual movies and spoken narratives have been used during \ac{fmri}
(s.\citet{hamilton2018revolution, hasson2008neurocinematics,
jaaskelainen2021movies, sonkusare2019naturalistic, saarimaki2021naturalistic}
for reviews), and \ac{eeg} or \ac{meg} data acquisition (s. \citet{alday2019meg,
kandylaki2019story} for reviews).
%
Early studies have shown that watching a movie \citep{hasson2004intersubject,
hasson2008neurocinematics, hasson2010reliability} or listening to a
narrative \citep{lerner2011topographic, wilson2008beyond} reliably synchronize spatiotemporal responses across multiple subjects
in a large part of the brain compared to, for example, an unedited video of a
concert taken from a fixed viewpoint \citep{hasson2004intersubject,
hasson2008neurocinematics, hasson2010reliability, lerner2011topographic,
wilson2008beyond}.
% This finding could be attributed to a film director's goal to not only direct
% a movie, but also to capture and direct the audience's attention; this can be
% attributed to the way professional movies are shot and edited in order to
% intentionally manipulate the viewers' attentional focus and mental states
% \citep{brown2012cinematography, dancyger2011film-technique}.
%
Further, a pioneering study \citep{bartels2004mapping} suggests that functional
specialization of cortical areas preserved during complex, life-like
stimulation.


\paragraph{Better compliance}

%
From a practical perspective, naturalistic stimuli promise improved subject
compliance regarding wakefulness and head motion due to minimal instruction
requirements (e.g. no fixation of eye gaze), task demands (no task except
enjoying the movie or audiobook).
%
This is especially the case for young children \citep{vanderwal2015inscapes},
and possibly psychiatric \citep{eickhoff2020towards} or elderly persons
resulting in increased data quality.
%
Since movies and audiobooks are interesting and easy-to-follow stimuli that are
produced to be engaging and immersive, they also promise to put participants at
ease in the otherwise claustrophobic, uncomfortable and noisy fMRI scanner.
%
Lastly, spoken narratives are also appropriate for visually impaired persons
suffering from diminished or lacking eye-sight.


\section{Prediction individual topography from a reference group}

% general idea
Given that one localizer = one domain of brain function is unsuitable to
characterize a variety of perceptual and cognitive processes in a time-efficient
manner, you could just predict the location in a ``new or  unknown'' subjects
from data of a reference group.


\subsection{Anatomical alignment}

\todo[inline]{write text in SRM chapter first; put a shorter version in here}


\subsection{Functional alignment}

\todo[inline]{write text in SRM chapter first; put a shorter version in here}

\todo[inline]{following is (still an old) draft}
%
``Even within a sensory modality, such as vision, different types of information
are layered and simultaneously present in natural movies. The rich, layered
information in movies has allowed concurrent modeling of multiple stages of
perceptual processing (Nishimoto et al., 2011; Huth et al., 2012; Güclü and van
Gerven, 2017). Broader sampling and efficient engagement of multiple systems
motivated the use of movie-viewing data as the basis for developing algorithms
for aligning functional anatomy (Conroy et al., 2009, 2013; Sabuncu et al.,
2010; Haxby et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2015; Guntupalli et al., 2016, 2018)''
\citep{haxby2020naturalistic}.

%
While the functional alignment can also be applied to fMRI data from stimulation
paradigms with simplified stimuli, the transformations for functional alignment
have greatly diminished general validity \citep{haxby2011common}, presumably
because such experiments sample a sparser range of brain states
\citep{guntupalli2016model}.
%
Increased validity of derived transformation for functional alignment by
sampling a more diverse set of mental states that reflect (confound) statistics
of the natural environment, and enable investigation of the acquired data for a
variety of research questions (e.g. visual or auditory perception, spatial
cognition; emotion; music, speech or social perception)

%
An alternative approach, to individual localization has been proposed by
\citet{haxby2011common}.
%
They (and e.g. \citet{jiahui2020predicting}) also predicted the location, form,
and size of target brain areas in medial ventral temporal cortex from dedicated
localizer scans of other individuals.
%
The key difference of this approach is to rely on similarity of representational
geometry of brain activity patterns and aligning individual brains into a
multi-dimensional functional group space, termed \ac{cms}.


\subsubsection{Hyperalignment}

\subsubsection{Shared response model}

\todo[inline]{write text in SRM chapter; put a shorter version in here}


\subsubsection{interim summary}
% interim summary
In summary, naturalistic stimuli ``impose a meaningful timecourse across
subjects while still allowing for individual variation in brain activity and
behavioral responses, and lend themselves to a broader set of analyses than
either pure rest or pure event-related task designs'' \citep{finn2017can}.


\section{Aims of thesis}
%% At the end of the introduction, add a subchapter on the Aims of Thesis in
%% which you describe the research question and the objectives of your work on
%% a maximum of two pages

\todo[inline]{imo, section should include roadmap/overview of work packages}

%
Previous work has shown on a group average level that it is possible to combine
\ac{bold} \ac{fmri} with naturalistic stimulation in order to localize areas
correlating with particular brain functions \citep{bartels2004mapping}.
%
This dissertation explores whether a movie and the movie's audio-description
that was produced for an visually impaired audience can substitute an
established localizer paradigm.
%
Naturalistic stimuli would have substantial advantages (e.g. task demands
compliance, and data quality) over simplified stimuli presently used in
localizer paradigms.
%
The time-courses of rich, full-length naturalistic stimuli are correlating with
a variety of different brain functions ranging from low-level perception (e.g.
luminance) to high-level cognition (social cognition).
%
Thus a naturalistic stimulus could, in principle, replace multiple dedicated
localizers to provide a more comprehensive diagnostic routine.

\todo[inline]{rephrase in line with the (to be written) part regarding \ac{cms}}
%
Nevertheless, a 2-hour paradigm would be unsuitable for a clinical population
and uneconomically.
%
For that reason, this dissertation will also explore whether just a part of a
naturalistic stimulus can be used to align an ``unknown'', left-out subject to a
\ac{cms} in order to a) map results from a functional localizer in a reference
group onto the unknown subject's anatomy and thus b) predict the results from
the functional localizer in the left-out subject.
%
In summary, we have two issues: a) validity and compliance, and b) efficiency.
% foreshadowing to next sections & transition to naturalistic stimuli
This dissertation will explore how we can both increase validity by using
\textit{naturalistic stimulus} paradigms as well as increase efficiency by
predicting individual functional topography from data collected in a reference
group.


\subsection{Open, transparent, and reproducible science}

%
\todo[inline]{quote a ``famous'' open science paper}
%
\todo[inline]{put more stuff from \citep{halchenko2021datalad} here?}
%
On a metalevel, this dissertation thrives to follow the principle of open
science [quote?], and provide transparent, reproducible procedures and results
\citep{poldrack2017scanning} that can easily rerun and validated by third-party
researchers.
% aim
Thus [wherever possible and as good as possible], I will follow and implement
best practices for a) coding and scientific computing \citep{wilson2014best}, b)
data analyses \citep{nichols2017best}, and c) sharing code, created data and
results \citep{eglen2017toward, nichols2017best}.


\subsubsection{input = open science \& studyforrest}

\todo[inline]{future (``will be created'') vs. perfect (``has been created'')?}

% open data \citep{eglen2017toward}
As input data, my work will be/is build on top of publicly and freely available,
\ac{fmri} data that is part of the \textit{studyforrest} project
(\href{www.studyforrest.org}{studyforrest.org}).
%
The studyforrest project is an open science project that aims at providing a
versatile resource for investigating human brain function under quasi-natural
conditions.
%
The core of this dataset are two hour long \ac{bold} \ac{fmri} scans of
participants watching the movie Forrest Gump and listening to the movie's
audio-description of equal length.
%
Since its first publication in 2014 \citep{hanke2014audiomovie}, this resource
has led to independent studies of international research groups that were
published in peer-reviewed journals (s.
\href{www.studyforrest.org}{studyforrest.org}).

\begin{comment} \citep{dupre2020nature}:
%
Study Forrest is a data collection and curation effort designed to serve as a
    community resource for new discoveries.
%
As of October 2019, 29 unique studies had been published using the
    studyforrest.org dataset, 17 of which were published without any of the
    original authors of the data release.
%
This is possible in large part thanks to the richness of naturalistic stimuli,
    where the same movie can be used for both task-free as well as
    stimulus-driven analyses, with the original stimulus re-annotated for
    particular features of interest.
%
For example, studyforrest.org has been used to test cerebrovascular biomarkers
    (Voss et al., 2017) but, among other features, was also annotated for
    expressed emotion (Labs et al., 2015) which later informed a study on
    emotion encoding gradients in the brain (Lettieri et al., 2019)''
    \citep{dupre2020nature}.
%
\end{comment}
%
Data, like stimulus annotations, that will/has been created of the course of the
dissertation project will provided in standardized file format,
version-controlled and published, and therefore extended the studyforrest
project.

%
\subsubsection{analyses, code, output}

%
All data analyses pipelines will be implemented in a way that enables automated
processing.
%
First, analyses pipelines will not be implemented using commercial, proprietary
software but freely available and, if possible, open-source software to
guarantee reproducibility (s. \citep{eglen2017toward}).
% which tools to choose why?
Among potential software packages, we/I will choose the tools that offer the
most solid documentation and basis of developers and maintainers to ensure
long-term support.
% my code
Second, any custom code written by myself will implemented in open-source
programming language, will be version-controlled, documented and released
publicly and freely accessible.\todo[inline]{are we actually allowed regarding
FZJ rules?}
%
Third, all input data, custom code and output data will be provided as
standardized and easy-to-access \textit{DataLad} (datalad.org) datasets, a free
and open-source software solution that manages provenience, distribution,
version-control of code and data, and provides a structured record of all
executed steps from downloading the input data to visualizing the results. The
information of past command-line invocations can be used to re-execute commands
to rerun every step and validate the results
\citep{halchenko2021datalad}.\todo{is direct quote?}

%
Consequently, all steps from acquiring the raw data, performing the analyses,
and visualizing the results can be check, rerun and validated by independent
badass motherfuckers.
%
Unthresholded statistical maps will additionally be accessible at Neurovault.


\href{https://neurovault.org/}{neurovault.org}
%
Since ``nature abhors a paywall'' \citep{dupre2020nature}, publications
describing generated data or reporting research results will be published in
open-access journals.
%
``Unthresholded statistical maps and the raw data would be shared
via appropriate community repositories, and the shared raw data would be format­
ted according to a community standard, such as the Brain Imaging Data Structure
(BIDS)73, and annotated using an appropriate ontology to enable automated
meta-analysis'' \citep{poldrack2017scanning}.


\subsection{Specific objectives and hypotheses}

\todo[inline]{print anno paper and write text here}


\subsubsection{A studyforrest extension, an annotation of spoken language in the
German dubbed movie ``Forrest Gump'' and its audio-description}

%
The majority of naturalistic stimuli that have been used in neuroscience have
originally been designed to entertain an audience and not to conduct research.
%
The time-courses of variables (i.e. the \textit{features}) embedded in a
naturalistic stimulus are fixed and thus reproducible [makes sense?].
%
Nevertheless, modeling brain activity correlating with stimulus features in
naturalistic stimuli is a challenging \citep{saarimaki2021naturalistic,
simony2020analysis} because models rely on  extensive stimulus annotations:
%
stimulus annotations need to comprise annotations of features of interest as
well as annotations of potentially confounding features.
%
The lack of extensive annotations of naturalistic stimuli has led to an ``usage
bottleneck'' \citep{aliko2020naturalistic} and might be the main reason why
explicit models of task or stimulus are often ``prohibitively difficult'' to
construct \citep{nastase2019measuring}.

% yeah, fuck it; I'll do it myself
Hence, I extended the studyforrest project with an annotation of spoken
language.
% content
``The annotation provides information about the exact timing of each of the more
than 2500 spoken sentences, 16000 words (including 202 non-speech
vocalizations), 66000 phonemes, and their corresponding speaker''
\citep{haeusler2021speechanno}.
%
Further, we explored the stimulus' confound structure and validated the
annotation's quality by building a model of hemodynamic activity based
information drawn from it.
%
Results suggested that the annotation could be used to model hemodynamic
responses correlating with auditory, semantic information in study 2.

\subsubsection{Processing of visual and non-visual naturalistic spatial
information in the ``parahippocampal place area''}

%
\todo[inline]{text is draft adapted from TeaP talk}
\todo[inline]{print PPA paper and write text here}

%
A previous analysis \citep{hanke2016simultaneous} revealed significant
correlations between \ac{bold} response time series of audio-visual movie and
its audio-description in spatially corresponding voxels of the ventral medial
cortices (s. Figure 3 in \citep{hanke2016simultaneous}).
%
we investigated if it is possible to localize a visual area, usually
identified via a task-based functional localizer, via naturalistic stimuli.
%
\citep{bartels2004mapping} annotated the occurrence (and perceived intensity)
regarding color, faces, language, and human bodies but, surprisingly, not
scenes.
%
Hence, it is still ``kind of unclear'' is if results generalize from
static pictures to results from a more ecologically valid stimuli
like a movie.
%
It is still unclear is if these results generalize to the auditory domain
\citep{aziz2008modulation}.
%
How can we operationalize the perception of spatial information that is
embedded in our naturalistic stimuli?
%
Notably, we operationalized the assumed perceptual process not just in a
audio-visual movie but also in an exclusively auditory stimulus.
%
Does increased hemodynamic activity in the PPA correlate with auditory spatial
information (group-level)?
%
Can we localize the PPA in individual persons using a more engaging
\& entertaining, but also exclusively auditory stimulus

Compare our results to a classic visual localizer experiment that used blocks of
pictures to results from naturalistic stimulus paradigms.
%
To operationalize the perception of spatial information, we looked at time
points in the stimuli that should correlate with the perception of spatial
information
%
For the movie, we used the movie cuts that basically re-orient the observer in
space.
%
For the audio-descriptions, we semantically categorized nouns spoken by the
narrator in case he used them to describe faces or bodies, locations, buildings,
rooms, and so on.

%
In both stimuli, we looked for time points correlating with other perceptual
processes that we needed to build general linear model contrasts.
%
create events from stimulus annotations;
%
model hemodynamic responses;
%
create contrast(s).

%
Results suggest that you can ``localize a auditory PPA'' but not the ``visual
PPA'' using an auditory narrative; It's similar but different; SRM study will
quantify the prediction performance
%
The audio-description must somehow at some time points trigger responses in the
ventromedial cortex.

%
There are responses in the parahippocampal cortex correlating with
spatial information.
%
But probably our event structure and model is not just an approximation of the
``real'' events structure that is actually correlated with the response series
in the parahippocampal cortex.
%
Hence: build shared response model and use it for prediction
%
2h movie/audio-description is to long anyway


\subsubsection{DataLad: distributed system for joint management of code, data,
and their relationship}

\todo[inline]{well, does not really fit in}


\subsubsection{Using varying amount of data from naturalistic stimulation for
functional alignment to predict results from a task-based functional localizer
paradigm}

\todo[inline]{following is a text adopted/adjusted from the project proposal}

%
All analyses up so far have been performed on 2h-long scans, but any
clinical application must aim to minimize the scan time/cost.
%
We tested whether reliable functional alignment can be achieved with a task-free,
natural stimulation ``calibration'' scan that requires no more acquisition time
than a conventional localizer paradigm.
%
fMRI data acquired from an individual will not be analyzed directly regarding a
specific cognitive function, but will be used to align that individual brain's
voxel space with a common high-dimensional representational reference space.
%
Using movie-evoked brain activity, hyperalignment procedure learns subject-wise
optimal transformations of brain activity into a common representational space.

%
Once aligned, the brain activity of the reference group can be used to predict
the activity of another subject.
%
Using a leave-one-subject-out strategy, individual results of the conventional
localizer will then be projected into the common space, aggregated, and
re-projected into the voxel space of the left-out individual for comparison with
the localizer results for that individual (see Figure 2).
%
Once a valid alignment is established, the inverse transformation is then used
to project functional properties of the common reference into that individual's
voxel space.
%
estimate the minimum scan time requirement for deriving a valid functional
alignment by further reducing the amount of input data of the left-out
individual.
%
We will estimate the trade-off between diagnostic quality and required effective
scan time by progressively reducing the duration of input BOLD fMRI data and
comparing the results of the reduced model to the reference computed from the
full length scan.
