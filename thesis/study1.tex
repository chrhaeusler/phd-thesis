%
Why does the dataset contain those annotations? Annotations are of utterly
importance in case you want to perform model-driven analyses
%
For example for a GLM: you want to build contrasts of interest; or you want to
build nuisance regressors just to explain variance
%
both movie and the audio-description provide spatial information.
%
let's try to use semantic spatial information for a proof of concept
%
The goal of this study is to create stimulus annotations to model hemodynamic
responses during the auditory naturalistic stimulation, and validate its quality
for the following studies.
