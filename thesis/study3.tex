\todo[inline]{I do not know if it makes sense to point to the paper in dedicated
chapter; maybe, just pointing it out at the beginning of the dissertation
(``parts of this dissertation have been published'') is enough.}

\todo[inline]{otherwise, this chapter could be first ``real'' chapter following
the general introduction or last chapter; but order should be similar to
how introduction and general discussion are structured}
